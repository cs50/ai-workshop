0
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:43,909
All

1
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:45,400
right,

2
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:47,369
this is CS 50,

3
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,409
and this is already week 8

4
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:50,369
and up until now,

5
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:50,610
of course,

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,860
in so many of our problem sets like we've been writing command line code

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,590
like a black and white terminal window and everything is very keyboard based,

8
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,490
very textual,

9
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,130
but of course like the apps that you and I are using like every

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,319
day are in the form of a web browser and on our phone.

11
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:06,889
And so today and really for the rest of the semester we now transition to

12
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:08,330
using all of the building blocks that we've

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,279
been accumulating over the past few weeks,

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,410
but to redeploy.

15
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,164
Them in the context of web apps and for your final project,

16
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:14,494
for instance,

17
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,204
if you so choose,

18
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:16,804
even mobile apps as well.

19
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,244
So today we're going to understand how the

20
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:20,844
internet that we use every day actually works.

21
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:23,204
We're going to introduce you to a language called HTML,

22
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:25,494
which is the language in which web pages are written,

23
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:26,874
a language called CSS,

24
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:30,594
which is the language with which web pages are stylized,

25
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,984
and then lastly JavaScript,

26
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,414
which of those is the only actual programming language.

27
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,424
But even though we'll spend quite a little time on it,

28
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:40,958
you'll see syntactically and Functionally it's very similar to C

29
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,877
to Python and languages indeed that have come before.

30
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:44,398
All right,

31
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,148
so we use the internet every day.

32
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,837
So what exactly is it?

33
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:47,998
Well,

34
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:48,917
in the simplest form,

35
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,547
like we've got networks in the world,

36
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,697
and networks are interconnections of computers,

37
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,458
whether with wires or wirelessly.

38
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:57,428
You have a network at home nowadays for the most part.

39
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,547
You certainly have a network on a campus like this.

40
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,038
In corporations you have networks,

41
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:02,877
so interconnections of computers.

42
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,237
As soon as you start networking the networks,

43
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,557
if not networking the networks.

44
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,222
Of networks you have in effect the internet.

45
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:11,472
So this global interconnection of computers,

46
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:12,072
servers,

47
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:12,552
devices,

48
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,992
and so many other things literally nowadays that we take for granted every day.

49
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:18,912
But how does it actually work and where did it come from?

50
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,072
Well,

51
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,472
if we rewind to like 1969,

52
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,311
the internet in its original form,

53
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:26,981
really something known as ARPANET for the Advanced Research Projects Agency,

54
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:30,781
a project from the Department of Defense that was really designed to

55
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:34,151
interconnect what limited supercomputers we had.

56
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:36,796
Back then that were otherwise geographically inaccessible

57
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:38,305
to so many researchers and others,

58
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:41,266
the internet or ARPANET really just looked like this

59
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,906
with UCLA and just a few other nodes,

60
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:44,505
so to speak,

61
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:45,815
interconnected somehow.

62
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,255
Just a year or so later,

63
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:50,455
did we have Harvard and MIT and others on the east coast,

64
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,296
and if we fast forward now to today,

65
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,255
of course we can find and route data most anywhere in the world.

66
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,255
And in fact,

67
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,535
the world is now filled with these things that are called

68
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:00,186
routers,

69
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:01,445
a router's just a computer,

70
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:01,725
a.

71
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,770
that routes data up,

72
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,029
down,

73
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,259
left,

74
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:04,580
right,

75
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:08,300
geographically and of course in the real world it might go out this wire here,

76
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:10,460
out this wire here out this wire or out this wire.

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,860
And in fact,

78
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,300
just to make more real what we're about to be talking about

79
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,570
when we talk about networks of computers and eventually the internet,

80
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,220
we engaged some of our teaching fellows over the past few years

81
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,619
to perform a little skit of sorts for us using Zoom,

82
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,330
if you will,

83
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,059
whereby each of the teaching fellows or humans you're

84
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,639
about to see consider them as representing a router,

85
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,339
a device on the.

86
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:31,483
whose purpose in life is to route data,

87
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:34,294
and what they're routing is what we're going to start calling packets,

88
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,694
packets of information which metaphorically you can think of

89
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,673
as just like a little white envelope like this

90
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:40,533
that we use to send things via snail mail

91
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,533
via the US Postal Service or beyond that internationally.

92
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,804
So I give you in just 60 seconds or so

93
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,964
what it means to send a packet on the internet,

94
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:49,843
for instance,

95
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,733
from Phyllis in the bottom right hand corner to a familiar face,

96
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,143
Brian at top left.

97
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,574
If we could dim the lights,

98
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:56,843
if only to be dramatic.

99
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,549
Thank

100
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,100
you.

101
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:27,329
Sure,

102
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,609
we can clap for that.

103
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,589
And we actually should clap for that because you're seeing

104
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,809
the sort of final version which looks kind of perfect,

105
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,130
but they were all smiling and clapping because it took us so

106
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,010
many damn takes to like actually get the coordination of that correct.

107
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,179
But for now assume that it was in fact correct,

108
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,660
but notice what's among the takeaways from even that little skit is that the packet,

109
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,649
the envelope from Phyllis to Brian could have taken any number of pads.

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,019
It could have gone up and then to the left.

111
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,309
It could have gone left and then up.

112
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,730
It could have zigzagged and the like,

113
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:57,500
and that's actually representative of how the world now looks because of so.

114
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,575
wires and so many wireless connections,

115
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:03,455
there's actually a lot of ways that data can travel from point A to point B,

116
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:06,665
and it turns out it's not even necessarily going to be the shortest difference.

117
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,585
It might be the least expensive dis

118
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,536
distance,

119
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:13,865
or perhaps just the result of how some humans or some how some servers

120
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:18,066
have automatically configured the routes to get from point A to point B.

121
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,786
So let's consider how the data is actually getting there.

122
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:22,105
So long story short,

123
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,466
all of those routers and indeed all the device.

124
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:25,351
is on the internet,

125
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,992
including the ones in your pocket or on your laps,

126
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,261
speak a language,

127
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,351
more technically a protocol nowadays known as TCP IP,

128
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,351
and this is actually a pair of protocols which is a

129
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,541
set of conventions that governs how computers behave on the internet.

130
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,502
In the human world we have protocols as well.

131
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:40,932
For instance,

132
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,261
when I meet someone for the first time,

133
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:45,101
I very often instinctively sort of extend my hand just sort

134
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:47,351
of hoping that they too will extend their hand and shake,

135
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:51,261
and that's a human protocol in that it governs how to people in that case.

136
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:52,247
Communicate.

137
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:52,437
Well,

138
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:54,398
servers have the same kinds of protocols,

139
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:57,148
but it's all text-based or bit-based instead of,

140
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:57,518
of course,

141
00:05:57,597 --> 00:05:58,108
physical.

142
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:02,877
But TCP and IP are two different protocols that solve two different problems.

143
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:04,667
And let's focus on the last of them first.

144
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:05,507
So IP,

145
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,108
short for Internet Protocol,

146
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,747
is simply a protocol that decides

147
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:13,828
to give all of us a unique address in the world.

148
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,437
In other words,

149
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:16,347
there are these things called IP addresses.

150
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,518
It's a numeric address that literally every computer.

151
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:21,803
In the world has in order to uniquely identify it.

152
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:23,234
Case in point in the real world,

153
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:24,324
we have addresses too.

154
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:24,723
For instance,

155
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:25,563
in this building here,

156
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:26,283
Memorial Hall,

157
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:27,723
we're at 45 Quincy Street,

158
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:28,123
Cambridge,

159
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:33,533
Massachusetts 02138 USA and theoretically that unique identifier should get an

160
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:36,734
envelope in the physical world to this location from any other

161
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:37,873
in the real world.

162
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:38,764
IP,

163
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,674
as applied to the internet,

164
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:42,743
just means that similarly do devices,

165
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:43,123
Macs,

166
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:43,723
PCs,

167
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:44,063
phones,

168
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,523
and everything else on the internet.

169
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:48,880
Have a unique identifier as well known as an IP address.

170
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:49,679
It's a number,

171
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,739
but it's typically formatted in dotted decimal notation,

172
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,250
so to speak,

173
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,850
so it's something.somethingsomethingsomething.

174
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,179
And just as a bit of trivia,

175
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,880
each of these number signs represents a value from 0 to 255.

176
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,000
So there are 4 such values apparently,

177
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,059
and just doing some quick we zero math,

178
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,649
if each of those values can be 0 to 255,

179
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,480
how many bits is an IP address,

180
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:12,489
presumably.

181
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,119
So 8 bits per number and how many was this?

182
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,769
So 32 bits,

183
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,730
because if you're counting from 0 to 255,

184
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:21,859
well,

185
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,309
it's 256 total possibilities,

186
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,200
that's 28,

187
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,079
which means 8 bits,

188
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,519
8 bits,

189
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,959
8 bits,

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,510
8 bits.

191
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,480
So IP addresses are 32 bits,

192
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,350
little trivia that's germane only insofar as it does kind of limit

193
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,070
how many total devices we could seem to have in the world.

194
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,399
If you've got only 32 bits,

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,390
how high can you count?

196
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,799
Roughly

197
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,619
So 2 to 32nd power,

198
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,980
which we generally ballpark as 4 billion,

199
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:48,790
which is to say you can have 4 billion devices total,

200
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,859
it would seem on the internet,

201
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,779
which is a big number,

202
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,510
but there's also a lot of humans nowadays,

203
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:56,470
and odds are most everyone in this room has at least 2 devices to their name,

204
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,070
maybe a phone and a laptop with which you're taking the course,

205
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,920
maybe even more devices thanks to the internet of things like smart home devices.

206
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,299
We have so many IP addresses being assigned to things.

207
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,390
So long story short,

208
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,940
the world is gradually

209
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,059
transitioning from this version here,

210
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:10,709
IPV.

211
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,269
4 to IPv6 which instead of using 32 bits is actually using 128 bits,

212
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:18,148
which is crazy large and gives us more

213
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:20,739
than enough IP addresses for the foreseeable future.

214
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:21,269
To be fair,

215
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,239
we've been talking about this for like 20-30 years,

216
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,039
transitioning from V4 to V6,

217
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,819
and it's still gradually in motion.

218
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,859
But for simplicity in the class and in general,

219
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:33,179
we'll still use IPv4 if only because it's a little easier to wrap your mind around.

220
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,629
Now this is admittedly a pretty arcane diagram,

221
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,008
but this is the diagram Ay art if you will,

222
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:44,668
that's in the Of official specification of what we mean by an IP datagram.

223
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:45,697
More colloquially,

224
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,617
this is what a packet actually looks like.

225
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:48,757
Now what are we looking at?

226
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:49,007
Well,

227
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,168
you're just looking at like a grid of bits.

228
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,487
So this here represents 32 bits total,

229
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,607
where this is bit zero,

230
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,117
and that's bit 31,

231
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,838
0 indexed all the way over there,

232
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,968
and then each row represents 32 more bits,

233
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:02,807
32 more bits,

234
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:03,648
32 more bits,

235
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:05,918
which is to say anytime a computer like Phyllis

236
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,578
sends an envelope of information on the internet.

237
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:10,877
It contains at least this information,

238
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:13,786
a whole bunch of bits broken down into bytes.

239
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:16,497
Now the only ones we'll really care about today are this one here,

240
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:17,577
source address,

241
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,617
which is to say when Phyllis sends that packet,

242
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,697
she writes her source address,

243
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:22,666
her IP address,

244
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:25,677
something.somethings.something on the outside of the envelope,

245
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:26,416
so to speak,

246
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,827
and she also puts Brian's IP address,

247
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:29,466
whatever that is,

248
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:30,137
something else,

249
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,267
something else that's something else,

250
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:33,906
do something else on the outside of the envelope as well.

251
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,827
There's a whole bunch of other bits involved which are useful,

252
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,427
but we'll wave our.

253
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,596
at those for today,

254
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,065
but that really speaks to what's actually happening.

255
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,596
And if we do this metaphorically

256
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:43,796
in the real world,

257
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,916
it's kind of like taking out that envelope.

258
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,046
And for instance,

259
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:52,075
if Brian's IP address is 1.2.3.4 for the sake of discussion,

260
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,625
Phyllis in advance of our filming that

261
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,765
bit would have written something like 1.2.3.4

262
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,356
in the middle of the envelope just like we would in the real world.

263
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,806
But presumably she wants Brian to be able

264
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:06,325
to reply to acknowledge receipt or send his.

265
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:07,094
own message.

266
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,375
So she's also going to put her IP address,

267
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,025
for instance,

268
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:11,664
in the top left corner

269
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:17,265
of the envelope 5.6.7.8 for the sake of discussion so that Brian knows when

270
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,604
he writes out his own packet of information how to actually or to whom

271
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:22,895
to reply.

272
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:25,744
But at the end of the day it's all just bits

273
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:29,255
being sent in a specific pattern and there is formal documentation.

274
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,104
It's the order in which all of those bits will

275
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:35,164
actually be sent out on the wire or wirelessly.

276
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:36,234
So in short,

277
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:39,883
IP ensures that all of us have unique IP addresses

278
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:43,033
via which data can go from us or to us.

279
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:44,924
That's only one problem nowadays,

280
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:45,244
of course,

281
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:46,653
servers can do so many other things.

282
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:47,393
They can do

283
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,033
email and chat and video conferencing,

284
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:50,804
game servers,

285
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:51,674
and who knows what,

286
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,674
and it would be nice if a single server certainly could do multiple things.

287
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:56,114
And in fact,

288
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:57,093
that's very much the case.

289
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,424
Single servers nowadays,

290
00:10:58,513 --> 00:10:59,924
and a server is just a term of art for

291
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:03,153
a computer used to serve information to other people.

292
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:03,854
By contrast,

293
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:08,023
our Laptops or desktops are generally clients because they only serve one of us,

294
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:09,013
not multiple people,

295
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,362
but these are just terms of art we're describing

296
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:12,982
at the end of the day still computers.

297
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:16,783
IP only ensures that we can uniquely address computers on the internet,

298
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:19,703
but there's another protocol in TCP IP,

299
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,973
namely the TCP portion

300
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:27,783
that allows computers to uniquely identify services that they're offering

301
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,853
to the rest of the world.

302
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,143
So for instance,

303
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:32,033
TCP

304
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,762
allows us to Allows a computer to distinguish whether

305
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,242
it has received a packet that's an email or

306
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:41,192
receive a packet that's a chat message or a piece of a video conference or the like,

307
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,161
which is to say there's more than just

308
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,401
IP addresses on the outside of these envelopes.

309
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,351
There are also what are called port numbers as well.

310
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:49,361
Similarly,

311
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:53,202
numeric numeric values that are usually in the range of

312
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:56,921
like 0 to 10 on up and the low thousands,

313
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:58,081
and they're standardized.

314
00:11:58,122 --> 00:11:58,752
For instance,

315
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:01,882
if you are requesting a webpage using HTTPo and.

316
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,411
Slash with which all of us are presumably familiar,

317
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,940
unbeknownst to you on the outside of

318
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,341
the virtual envelope that your computer subsequently

319
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:13,541
sends is the port number 80 because when the server receives that it knows,

320
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:13,950
oh,

321
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:16,221
this human is requesting a web page and

322
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,611
not for instance their email or something else.

323
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:22,570
Or nowadays if you're using HTTPS where the S denotes secure

324
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:23,591
in the URL,

325
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,940
you're actually using port 443,

326
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,981
which is just an arbitrary number that a bunch of humans in

327
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,870
a room decided on years ago to standardize what goes on.

328
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:32,090
The outside of an envelope.

329
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,570
So just to be more clear then,

330
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,229
when Phyllis is sending a request to Brian,

331
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,919
and if Phyllis,

332
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,280
for instance,

333
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,140
is the client,

334
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,630
just a human using a computer,

335
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,010
and Brian in this story is now a web server,

336
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,669
better yet,

337
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,869
a secure web server that's somehow encrypting or scrambling the information

338
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,070
to keep it secure,

339
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:48,349
well,

340
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:51,770
on the outside of this envelope after Brian's IP address,

341
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,869
which was 1.2.3.4,

342
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:58,140
Phyllis is also going to write the number 443,

343
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,458
so that when Brian receives an open This envelope,

344
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,898
he knows what he's looking at a request for a web page

345
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,489
and not an email or a chat message or something else.

346
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,268
Moreover,

347
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:08,408
we can continue the story just a little bit further.

348
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:14,328
Phyllis also writes on the envelope not only her IP address 5.6.7.8,

349
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:18,059
but some number as well in that top left hand corner,

350
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:19,328
whatever it happens to be,

351
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,729
which is a port number via which Brian can reply to her.

352
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:23,528
In this way,

353
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,299
Phyllis can in effect have multiple tabs open,

354
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,619
be using Zoom and uh.

355
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:31,918
Some chat software or something else running multiple programs on

356
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:34,788
her computer and the internet packets are all coming in,

357
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:40,677
but her computer knows to which tabs or applications those packets belong.

358
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,598
So if you really want to geek out,

359
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:43,947
here's what this thing looks like.

360
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:47,708
This is just the sequencing of bits for TCP as well,

361
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,638
which is to say in addition to the dozens of bits we looked at a

362
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:54,708
moment ago that standardize what IP is putting on the outside of the envelope,

363
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:57,567
TCP is adding 16.

364
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,286
bits that specify a port number,

365
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:02,257
which means you can indeed have tens of thousands of possible port numbers,

366
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,846
a destination port number,

367
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,127
and a bunch of other stuff including

368
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:07,836
this so-called sequence number,

369
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:11,687
which happens to be a 32 bit value which is actually pretty important

370
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:16,447
because quite often when sending messages on the internet they're pretty large

371
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,697
and it would be nice if one person downloading a big image or

372
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:23,817
one person downloading a movie or streaming a movie doesn't mean that no

373
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,416
one else on the internet can do something else at that moment.

374
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:26,935
Time.

375
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,116
So for the sake of discussion,

376
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,356
suppose that this very happy cat here is a very large JPEG,

377
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:31,676
for instance,

378
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:33,356
a very large graphical file.

379
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:34,185
It would be nice,

380
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:38,986
let's say that if Phyllis is trying to send or receive an image as large as this,

381
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:42,515
it's not just in one massive envelope that's going to prevent a whole bunch

382
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,145
of other users from similarly using the internet at that moment in time.

383
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:48,036
So at the risk of a bit of heresy,

384
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:50,226
we can actually tear this cat

385
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:51,935
in half and

386
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:53,666
fragment it really

387
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,195
and then inside of fill.

388
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,965
This envelope or equivalently Brian's reply,

389
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:01,405
depending on where this cat is coming from or going to

390
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,895
part of that cat can go in this envelope and now

391
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,604
say in the bottom left hand corner of this envelope,

392
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:12,294
Phyllis or Brian could write the sequence number in question 1 out

393
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,934
of 42 out of 43 out of 44 out of 4,

394
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,724
so that when this and hopefully the other packets arrive at their destination,

395
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,844
the recipient's computer can check,

396
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:21,294
OK,

397
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,405
this was a really big file in this case,

398
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:24,744
do I have all of the Parts,

399
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:25,124
yes,

400
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:28,114
it can be inferred from the so-called sequence number,

401
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,684
which we've represented there in that memo field of the envelope.

402
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,114
There's a bunch of other stuff that can go on here too,

403
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:36,064
including prioritization of data as well,

404
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:41,193
but ultimately TCP just allows servers to handle multiple types

405
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:46,414
of services and also allows it to receive data reliably,

406
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,434
because if,

407
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:48,263
for instance,

408
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:52,633
a recipient only gets 2 out of the 4 packets or 3 out of the 4 packets,

409
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:53,033
the fact.

410
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:55,742
That there's a sequence number involved is enough information

411
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,492
for that recipient to say to the sender,

412
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:57,752
Hey,

413
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,853
I'm missing 1 or 2 or 3 or more packets.

414
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,023
Please resend them.

415
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:02,812
So in short,

416
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:05,283
TCP guarantees delivery

417
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:08,653
by just doing some bookkeeping on the outside of these envelopes.

418
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:09,172
So in short,

419
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:12,083
IP allows us to uniquely identify computers,

420
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:15,552
and TCP guarantees delivery and allows us to multiplex,

421
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:16,283
so to speak,

422
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:19,203
among multiple services on the same device.

423
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:22,013
Questions on the this jargon.

424
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,349
Thus far,

425
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,109
because it is filled with acronyms,

426
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:25,950
unfortunately.

427
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,630
Questions IP TCP.

428
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,219
Or anything

429
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:32,250
else,

430
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,799
OK,

431
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,619
so seeing none,

432
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,140
uh,

433
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:35,669
as promised,

434
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,390
let's do yet another acronym.

435
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,549
So it would be pretty tedious if Phyllis and Brian and all of us

436
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,229
humans had to write actually IP addresses

437
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:45,549
into our browsers when visiting websites.

438
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:46,619
And in fact,

439
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,750
when most of us never do that,

440
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,950
instead we go to Google.com or Harvard.edu or actual domain names,

441
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:54,349
so to speak,

442
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,390
which were so much easier for us humans to remember than these ar.

443
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:00,161
IP addresses that are either automatically assigned to

444
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:04,080
computers or manually configured by humans configuring servers,

445
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,040
but there's another acronym in the world and

446
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,119
there's another technology used on the internet,

447
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,951
namely DNS for domain name system,

448
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,951
and this is just a certain type of server

449
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,390
that every home has,

450
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:15,951
even if you didn't know it.

451
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,760
Every campus has,

452
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,951
every company has.

453
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,880
There are so many DNS servers around the world,

454
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,681
but their purpose in life quite simply is to translate

455
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:26,080
what you and I know as domain names like Google.

456
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:27,641
Harvard.edu,

457
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:31,052
and the like into their corresponding IP addresses.

458
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,001
And so in short,

459
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:36,281
inside of these DNS servers are essentially like a two column table or spreadsheet,

460
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,411
however you want to think about it,

461
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:40,001
whereby here is all of the domain names in the world.

462
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,521
Here are all of the corresponding IP addresses in the world.

463
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,462
And so when your Mac or PC or phone

464
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:46,842
being used by you

465
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:49,732
is trying to access Google.com or Harvard.edu,

466
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:50,651
that device,

467
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,052
certainly when it's first booted up,

468
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:53,241
has no idea

469
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:54,692
what IP address.

470
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,652
The IP address is for that server.

471
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,782
It's not the case that Apple or Google are

472
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:02,692
pre-installing billions of IP addresses inside of our devices,

473
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:06,863
but your device is smart enough to ask the local network at home,

474
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:07,343
on campus,

475
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:07,973
or at work,

476
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:08,223
well,

477
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:10,532
what is the IP address of Google.com?

478
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,302
What is the IP address of Harvard.edu?

479
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:13,302
and then what your Mac,

480
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:13,583
PC,

481
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:17,463
or phone actually do upon getting that answer from one of these local DNS

482
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:22,902
servers is it writes the corresponding IP address on the outside of that envelope.

483
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:23,322
So it's a wonderful.

484
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:25,723
A useful service that just makes the internet

485
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:28,114
more useful for you and I to use because we

486
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,874
can use names instead of IP addresses as well.

487
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,673
Technically these things are called fully qualified domain names.

488
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:34,673
Where do they come from?

489
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:34,913
Well,

490
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,994
some of you might actually have your own personal website.

491
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,114
You might have gone through this process.

492
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:40,514
It's actually not that hard to get your own domain name.

493
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:42,354
You can go to any number of what are

494
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,703
called internet registrars and pay them some money,

495
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,713
and it's essentially on a rental basis,

496
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:51,913
so you rent a domain name for a year or maybe 3 or 5 years at a time.

497
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,964
can automatically bill you the domain name might be

498
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:56,925
as little as $1 per year or thousands of

499
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:59,084
dollars per year depending on whether someone has scooped

500
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,954
it up and is maybe squatting or the like,

501
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:01,635
but

502
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:04,484
all you do ultimately is pay someone money and they

503
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,125
give you the rights to use that domain name.

504
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,525
And then what you do technically is you configure

505
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:11,915
some DNS server somewhere in the world to know what

506
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:15,685
the eventual IP address is for your server that's

507
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:18,885
going to serve up your domain names web pages.

508
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:19,765
And long story short,

509
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:20,484
with DNS.

510
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,839
I say that you have one in your home and in your work

511
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,069
and in your campus because it's a very hierarchical kind of structure.

512
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,219
Like there is out there somewhere these so-called root servers that essentially

513
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:33,760
know what the IP addresses are of all of the dot-coms,

514
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,219
for instance,

515
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,520
or all of the dot EDUs or the like,

516
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,079
but my Mac doesn't know that.

517
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:41,119
And so my Mac might actually ask that root server what.

518
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,040
That IP address,

519
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,550
but

520
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,469
in more efficiently,

521
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,550
my Mac is better still going to ask the local network first.

522
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,310
When I'm at home,

523
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,839
it asks my home DNS server,

524
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,510
which is built into the little home router that you've got somewhere in there,

525
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:53,880
or if you're on campus,

526
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,630
it asks Harvard's DNS server,

527
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,880
and this whole design is recursive,

528
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,709
to borrow a term from a few weeks ago,

529
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,510
in that if my computer doesn't know.

530
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,069
Answer.

531
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,790
What's the IP address for this domain?

532
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,280
If Harvard doesn't know the answer,

533
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:08,290
it eventually gets escalated to those so-called root servers,

534
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,270
but then cached that is remembered by all of these other DNS servers along the way.

535
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,359
So it's a very elegant hierarchical design,

536
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,670
but at the end of the day it's just doing this.

537
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
It's a big cheat sheet of domain names to

538
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,810
IP addresses and the server is responding for us.

539
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,729
All right,

540
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:23,780
one more acronym.

541
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,599
So how do I know what my Mac IP address should be?

542
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,369
How do I know what my phone's IP address should be?

543
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,260
How do I know what the IP address is of the DNS

544
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,739
server of whom I should be asking any of these questions?

545
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,770
How do I know the IP address of the router to whom to hand my data off to?

546
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,089
Like there's a lot of assumptions built into the story we've been telling,

547
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,099
and the answer is unfortunately yet another acronym DHCP

548
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:49,329
is the solution to all of those problems,

549
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:52,219
and it wasn't always back in my day we used to have to manual.

550
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:55,005
We type in what our computer's IP address was based

551
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,436
on what some human told us it would be.

552
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,005
We had to type in our DNS server,

553
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,276
type in our router address,

554
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:00,765
but

555
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:01,765
now

556
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:02,836
DHCP

557
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,156
is just yet another server running in your home network,

558
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,326
running on campus,

559
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:09,446
running in your corporate network whose purpose in

560
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:11,235
life is to answer questions of the form.

561
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,306
What is my IP address,

562
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,875
which is to say when you boot up your Mac,

563
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:15,326
your PC,

564
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:16,676
your phone for the first time,

565
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:19,086
it essentially broadcasts a message like Hello world,

566
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,215
what's my IP address?

567
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,166
And hopefully there's one such.

568
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,421
DHCP server on that local network wired or wirelessly

569
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:31,312
that will respond based on how Harvard or Comcast or Verizon or someone at

570
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:34,552
home has configured it to tell you what your device's IP address is,

571
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,592
what the IP is of your local router,

572
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,911
what the IP address is or are of your DNS servers,

573
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:40,901
and the like.

574
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:43,661
And so this is why things just work nowadays once you've

575
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:47,421
connected to like a Wi Fi network or physically plugged in.

576
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:50,182
Dynamic host configuration protocol didn't always exist.

577
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,021
Wonderful that it now does.

578
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,380
All right,

579
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,099
enough sort of outside of the envelope stuff.

580
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:59,219
Everything else today will be a deeper dive

581
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:01,699
inside the inside of this envelope to look at

582
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:04,390
what actually are the messages that we are sending,

583
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:05,180
receiving,

584
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,160
how are you structuring the web pages and designing everything

585
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,339
that comes back from the server to the client.

586
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,069
And let's dive in then to

587
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,989
this acronym HTTP,

588
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:16,349
which you've been typing for years or seeing for years,

589
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,630
even though you don't really have to type

590
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,829
it anymore because browsers just assume that this.

591
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:20,767
What you want,

592
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:23,848
but HTTP is another protocol,

593
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,728
hypertext Transfer Protocol,

594
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:30,017
whose purpose in life is to request web pages and receive web pages.

595
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,728
As a protocol,

596
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:33,338
it just standardizes like what goes inside of that

597
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:35,567
envelope when you're trying to use the web.

598
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:37,588
There are different protocols for email,

599
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,297
different protocols for Zoom,

600
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:40,848
different protocols for Discord,

601
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,718
and any number of other internet services.

602
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:45,287
We'll focus predominantly today on HTTP,

603
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,297
which happens to use ports 80 and 4.

604
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,595
For 3 among others as we saw.

605
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,255
So let's see what HTTP it

606
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:53,556
is all about,

607
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:54,686
or HTTPS,

608
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:57,395
the corresponding secure version thereof.

609
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:58,765
So here is a URL,

610
00:22:58,926 --> 00:22:59,875
canonical URL,

611
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:02,005
in that it has a whole bunch of components.

612
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,765
Let's consider what some of the jargon is

613
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:05,125
that we're going to start taking for granted.

614
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:09,985
So if you go to HTTPS www.example.com/,

615
00:23:10,326 --> 00:23:14,765
you are implicitly requesting the root of that website.

616
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,894
Root just means the default directory,

617
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:17,833
the default folder,

618
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:18,303
if you will,

619
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:20,433
and that's what the yellow highlighted slash here

620
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,384
just means like give me the default webpage.

621
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:23,543
Technically speaking,

622
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,614
what you're going to receive in your browser,

623
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:26,494
unbeknownst to you,

624
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:27,624
is an actual file.

625
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,634
By convention it's a file called index.html,

626
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:33,953
maybe index.htm or any number of other files,

627
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:34,423
but

628
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,994
it would be pretty stupid if we as humans all had

629
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:39,423
to type out the actual file name that we want.

630
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:42,154
So the server by default is just going to return you the root.

631
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:43,832
Of the website.

632
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,822
If though you're inside of a folder or you do actually

633
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:48,421
click on a link that leads you to a file,

634
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:53,621
you might very well have at the end of this domain name a full path as well,

635
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,862
which might contain zero or more folder names and 0

636
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,911
or more file 0 or 1 file names as well.

637
00:23:59,102 --> 00:23:59,332
In fact,

638
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:05,302
it could be explicitly file.html or folder or folder file.html.

639
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:07,592
You've probably seen thousands of these over time,

640
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,621
even if you haven't really given it much thought.

641
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:13,489
So we today onward will be creating all of this stuff here,

642
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,400
but we need to understand what's going on to the left too.

643
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,369
So here's the so-called domain name,

644
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,969
or more properly the fully qualified domain name,

645
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,719
and it has a few different parts too.

646
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,410
So this is technically the domain name as we all refer to it,

647
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,979
something.something.com means commercial

648
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,930
and that.com is more specifically known as a top level domain or T.

649
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:38,281
LD back in the day there were only a few of these.gov.com,

650
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,271
.net.org.edu,

651
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,031
and a bunch of others.

652
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,302
Now there's hundreds if not thousands of them.

653
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:45,952
Many of them aren't really used prominently in the wild,

654
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:50,592
but there are some not on that original list like CS50 uses.io a lot,

655
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,432
which doesn't mean input output.

656
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:55,822
It's actually a two letter country code that has been

657
00:24:57,271 --> 00:24:58,192
essentially rented to.

658
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:02,104
Us and anyone else using that same TLD because in the English speaking world.

659
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,614
I actually sounds kind of cool.

660
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:07,154
It's kind of connotes indeed input and output.tv is

661
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:09,124
another one that actually belongs to a country,

662
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,323
but in fact also sounds like in English television,

663
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,043
and so that too has been used as well.

664
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,413
But in general there are top level domains like these.

665
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:18,703
Some of them now are full words,

666
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:21,524
some of them are two characters denoting they belong to a country.

667
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:22,423
They are.

668
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:27,276
The sort of top level indeed categorization of all of these websites.

669
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:27,755
Meanwhile,

670
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:28,625
many URLs,

671
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:29,115
but not all,

672
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,196
also have something to the left of the domain name known as a host name

673
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,515
which technically speaking refers to the name

674
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:37,046
of the server that you're requesting specifically.

675
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:38,865
It doesn't have to be literally one server.

676
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:41,755
www can refer to dozens of hundreds,

677
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:43,135
thousands of servers.

678
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:43,426
Indeed,

679
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:46,595
if you go to any popular website like gmail.com or the like.

680
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,839
Even though you only have one domain name,

681
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,569
somehow or other technologically,

682
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,250
it is referring to clusters of hundreds or thousands of servers that ensure

683
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,329
that they can handle all of the customers that might visit that site.

684
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,329
And then lastly there's this the scheme or the protocol in use

685
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:05,250
specifically and for our discussion today it's always going to be HDPS,

686
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,119
which is ideal because it's secure and encrypted somehow,

687
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:12,170
but it can also be indeed HTTP colon lash.

688
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:13,020
So that's it.

689
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,079
Like that's just the jargon with which you should

690
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,959
be familiar when it comes to URLs like these,

691
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:21,449
and what we'll be doing today is actually creating content that

692
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:25,560
lives at URLs like that and serving it up to us,

693
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,916
but What do the messages ultimately look like

694
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,756
that are going inside of these envelopes?

695
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:34,587
What the URLs are doing are just getting us to the right place,

696
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:38,237
but how do we express in some form of code that we

697
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:43,506
want this file.html from this server using encryption in this way?

698
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:43,756
Well,

699
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,357
inside of the virtual envelopes that Phyllis was sending to

700
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,947
Brian and he would have ultimately sent back to her

701
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:51,266
are messages that look like this

702
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:52,437
get

703
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:53,357
post.

704
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,073
And a bunch of other verbs,

705
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:55,663
if you will.

706
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:59,213
So HTTP supports a bunch of operations or verbs,

707
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,134
namely get Post and a few others,

708
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:04,624
and it was indeed the first of these that Phyllis would have put inside of

709
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:09,014
her envelope initially in order to get a web page like a cat from Ryan.

710
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,374
Specifically inside of the envelope she would have had a textual message.

711
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:13,654
It's not code per se.

712
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:16,293
There's no functions or loops or variables or anything like that.

713
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,823
It's a protocol just in the sense that humans years ago standardized what.

714
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:24,090
messages should appear inside of those envelopes if you

715
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,081
want to get a webpage from a server.

716
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,051
So for instance,

717
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,811
if Brian in this story is now suddenly

718
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:29,961
Harvard.edu,

719
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,470
specifically www.harvard.edu,

720
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,571
Phyllis's envelope would have contained a message saying get in all caps slash

721
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,781
if she just wants the root or the default page from Brian's server,

722
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:41,811
the version of HTTP that she's using,

723
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,211
for instance,

724
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,081
version 2,

725
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,490
and she would also specify just in case Brian

726
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,211
is multitasking and serving up websites for different.

727
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:52,557
Domain names on the same physical box which actual host that she wants,

728
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,748
and maybe a bunch of other lines as well.

729
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:56,677
And hopefully if all goes well,

730
00:27:56,838 --> 00:28:02,508
Brian would have responded with an envelope of his own containing an HTTP response

731
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:07,358
in answer to her HTTP request and Brian's envelope would have contained a textual

732
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:11,637
message that just confirms what version of HTTP he's using a status code,

733
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:15,677
which is an arcane number that just indicates in this case that everything is OK.

734
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:16,954
All is well,

735
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:19,944
and he would specify the type of content he's sending back

736
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:22,555
to her in his own envelope because it could be HTML.

737
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:24,094
More on that later today.

738
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,145
It could be a JPEG,

739
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:25,795
it could be a GIF.

740
00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:27,895
It could be any number of other file formats,

741
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:30,464
and this is just a hint to Phyllis's browser as to

742
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:33,574
what's going to be inside of that envelope she is getting back

743
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:37,494
within her browser and then maybe a bunch of other stuff as well.

744
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:39,744
So even though some of these details,

745
00:28:39,864 --> 00:28:43,125
like these underlying implementation details might visually be.

746
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:45,932
New to you if you've never really thought about it.

747
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:50,612
Turns out we as aspiring programmers can actually see and and poke

748
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:53,722
around with these building blocks and ultimately today take advantage of them.

749
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:55,932
So you're about to see a program that's called Curl,

750
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,491
which stands for Connect URL.

751
00:28:57,692 --> 00:29:00,371
It's installed in Linux systems like CS50.dev.

752
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:04,651
It also comes with Macs and PCs quite frequently or you can easily install it and

753
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:07,612
essentially it's a headless browser that allows you

754
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,641
to pretend to be a browser and grab

755
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:10,531
the response.

756
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:14,318
from a server by pretending to send by actually sending

757
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:15,869
the contents of

758
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,249
an envelope like this.

759
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,078
So for instance,

760
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,198
if I want to pretend to be a browser and request harvard.edu,

761
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:26,639
I can type this in my CS50.d terminal window and let me

762
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,928
go ahead and maximize that size and do the following Curl I,

763
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:33,558
which specifically is only going to show me the headers,

764
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,958
the text that we were just talking about,

765
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,918
and it's not going to send any of the contents of Harvard's website.

766
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,329
Curl I HTTPs www.

767
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,579
Harvard.edu.

768
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,170
So if I were typing this into a browser,

769
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,089
I would actually see Harvard's homepage.

770
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,800
In this case,

771
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,459
I'm just going to see the contents of the

772
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,880
envelope as black and white text on the screen,

773
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,050
specifically only the first few lines,

774
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,209
the so-called headers that the server is responding with

775
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:00,199
just as I claimed Brian would to fill us.

776
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:01,250
I hit enter.

777
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,369
And there's indeed more lines than I had in my slide,

778
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:08,099
but you can see that everything is in fact 200 OK.

779
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,060
This is a convention.

780
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,989
200 means all is indeed OK.

781
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,709
There's a bunch of other information here,

782
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:15,170
including the date and time in which this response came back.

783
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,739
Here's that content type line text HTML and then some other

784
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:21,969
details and a whole bunch of other information as well.

785
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,819
So that's one way of seeing what's going on underneath the hood.

786
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:25,979
Well,

787
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:28,739
what other responses might come back?

788
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:28,900
Well,

789
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:32,930
it turns out that 200 OK is the best possible outcome,

790
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,630
but there's another,

791
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,140
a bunch of other outcomes that are possible as well.

792
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,880
For instance,

793
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,800
sometimes

794
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,310
you'll get not 200,

795
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,650
but 301,

796
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,810
which means moved permanently

797
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,569
colloquially speaking.

798
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:46,339
And what does this mean?

799
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,579
Well,

800
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:50,060
if a server responds to a browser with a numeric code of 301.

801
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,569
That means that the browser is supposed to go to this location instead.

802
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,849
It's sort of like putting a

803
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:59,089
detour sign on the server that says there's nothing for you here.

804
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,010
Go over here to this location instead.

805
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,849
And now notice in this example it's telling

806
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:09,770
the user to go to HTTPs www.harvard.edu/.

807
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,380
That's actually.

808
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:11,359
What I typed before,

809
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,469
so I would not have seen that myself.

810
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,650
But if I go back to VS code here and let's run the exact same command,

811
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:22,400
but let's try to visit the insecure version of Harvard's website HTTP and Slash,

812
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,040
which just means that anyone else on the internet can technically

813
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,479
see what it is I am now doing with my browser,

814
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,829
which might not be desirable,

815
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,520
enter.

816
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,709
This time Harvard Server does not just tell me 200,

817
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:35,420
OK,

818
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,750
it actually says 301 move permanently,

819
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,310
and if I read lower in these lines,

820
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,349
there indeed is the location to which I

821
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,219
should actually go and it's a subtle difference.

822
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,140
It's forcing me to go to HTTPS instead

823
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,430
without actually showing me the contents of Harvard's.

824
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:51,125
So nowadays you and I don't even have to think about this.

825
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:57,905
You and I are not even in the habit surely of typing HTTP or HTTPS,

826
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:01,805
but the browser is ensuring in this case that you are redirected,

827
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:02,444
so to speak,

828
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:06,234
automatically to the secure version of that site instead.

829
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:08,165
Now there's other status codes and in fact,

830
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:10,155
even if you never realized it before now,

831
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:12,525
what numeric code do you essentially you sometimes

832
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:14,165
see on the internet when something goes wrong?

833
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:15,829
404.

834
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:20,420
So 404 is a weirdly public arcane error number error

835
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,689
number or status code that just means file not found,

836
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,900
and we can simulate this as follows.

837
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,489
For instance,

838
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,410
if I ink my terminal window,

839
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:33,530
do curl I HDPs www.harvard.edu.

840
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,219
I'll suppose that Harvard has a whole department dedicated to cats,

841
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,089
which it does not,

842
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,496
but if I Enter here,

843
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:43,796
you'll see that I get an HTTP 2404 status code,

844
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:46,496
which just means the website does not in fact exist.

845
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:52,087
And if I visited HDPSwww.Harvard.edu/cats in my browser,

846
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:56,847
I would presumably see some error page that may or may not show me visually 404,

847
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,136
but many websites,

848
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:00,266
most websites for better or for worse,

849
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:02,813
reveal this number so much so that Most everyone

850
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,923
in this room is probably familiar with 404,

851
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:09,213
even though its origin is this very low level arcane status

852
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:15,124
code buried in the HDB headers inside of envelopes like these.

853
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,854
There's a whole bunch of others if you'd like some fun facts.

854
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,494
200 is indeed OK.

855
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,973
301 is moved permanently.

856
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:24,563
There's a bunch of other 300 ones that all relate to go elsewhere.

857
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,134
400 generally means.

858
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,321
that you as the user have somehow done something wrong or

859
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,541
next week as we start writing code that talks to web servers,

860
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,921
maybe your code has done something wrong when requesting a website.

861
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:37,451
500s are really bad.

862
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,240
It means the server is messed up somehow,

863
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,961
either it's not available or the programmer made some

864
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:44,760
bug in their code such that it's crashing with,

865
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,140
for instance,

866
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:46,760
something like an internal server error.

867
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:48,090
We included 418,

868
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,240
which is not actually a thing,

869
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:49,970
but it was a fun.

870
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,290
A sort of April Fool's joke years ago where a bunch of humans thought it would

871
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,869
be funny to write up a whole specification for what it means for a server to respond

872
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,989
with a number of 418

873
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,250
inside joke.

874
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:03,420
Not funny at the moment,

875
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:07,089
but it is sort of part of internet lore nowadays.

876
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,219
We can have a little bit of fun with this,

877
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,649
maybe with the at the expense of our dear friends down the road.

878
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,790
For years now,

879
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,780
someone has been paying for.

880
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:17,510
Uh,

881
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,949
the following behavior.

882
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,219
Let me go back to VS code here in my terminal window.

883
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:28,629
Let me do curl-I HTTP cosafetyschool.org.

884
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,649
Have you ever been?

885
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:31,620
Ever apply perhaps?

886
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:31,909
Well,

887
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,659
let me actually go to HDP/safetyschool.org,

888
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:38,270
and just for fun,

889
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,100
hit enter.

890
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,219
Oh my goodness,

891
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,860
look at where we are.

892
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,998
So how is this implemented?

893
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:45,217
Well,

894
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,697
if I finish what I began over here by just looking at

895
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:51,888
the HDB headers inside of the envelope my actual browser just sent to

896
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:53,539
safetyschool.org

897
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:55,217
for like 20 years,

898
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:59,569
presumably some Harvard alum has been paying the bill to rent this domain

899
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:04,099
name just to have this trick implemented such that 301 moved permanently.

900
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:07,489
is directing people ever since to yale.edu.

901
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,050
There's a bunch of others if you go down the

902
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,040
rabbit hole of looking on Reddit and the like Stanford,

903
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:11,379
Berkeley,

904
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,889
there's a healthy competition on East Coast and West Coast,

905
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:19,439
but it all boils down to very arcane understanding of how HTTP works,

906
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:25,169
the protocol that governs how data is sent from web browsers to web servers.

907
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:29,909
Now you can of course use Curl for connecting to URLs in the context of something like

908
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:33,020
CS50.d. You could have been doing stuff like this

909
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,070
all the time though with your actual browser.

910
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,620
So I'm using Chrome here,

911
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,320
but most any browser nowadays has the ability to give you developer tools natively,

912
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:45,360
which is to say somewhere there should be a menu

913
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,590
option that lets you use developer tools that are conducive to

914
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,590
someone who knows a bit of programming to poking around underneath

915
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,669
the hood of the browser and see what's going on.

916
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:54,070
For instance,

917
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm going to go ahead and open up a new window here and I'm going to right click on the

918
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,120
background or I can go to the appropriate menu in

919
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,280
Chrome's menu and I'm going to go to inspect,

920
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:08,199
which pulls up what we're going to call developer tools.

921
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,429
I'm doing it incognito mode for reasons we'll see next week.

922
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,639
This has the effect of clearing automatically any of my cookies,

923
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,669
my browser history,

924
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,010
because most any time I do something with the web browser today,

925
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,879
I want to pretend like I'm doing it for the very

926
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:22,760
first time so that the behavior is exactly as we suspect.

927
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:23,830
expect.

928
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,780
So down here now that I've opened up the so-called developer tools in Chrome and they

929
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,209
look almost the same in Safari and Edge and a bunch of other browsers as well,

930
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,870
I will see a tab called Elements which shows me

931
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,260
all of the elements of this webpage once it appears,

932
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,090
including the so-called HTML code we're about to write.

933
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:43,300
I can see a console where error message might sometimes appear

934
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,090
similar in spirit to the terminal window in VS code.

935
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,179
I can also see the network connections.

936
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,100
The browser is making to the server and that's

937
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,050
where I thought we'd start our attention here.

938
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:54,330
Here I have a brand new browser window.

939
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,489
I'm clicking on network over here

940
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,020
just to make sure we can see everything without it getting automatically deleted.

941
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,100
I've clicked on preserve log and disable cache

942
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:05,489
just so that it behaves exactly as expected.

943
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:07,780
And now let's go up here for the first

944
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,260
time in this Incognito window and go to HTTP/safetyschool.org.

945
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:14,459
Enter

946
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,570
and you'll see a whole bunch of

947
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:20,879
outputs including this warning in this particular mode.

948
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,429
This is increasingly common nowadays for websites that do not support HTTPS,

949
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,290
which this alum hasn't been paying for.

950
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:30,139
You'll get a warning typically that specifies you might

951
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:31,770
not want to do this because the whole world,

952
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:34,330
at least the whole world between you and point B,

953
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,320
might know what it is you're

954
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:37,489
accessing on the web.

955
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:39,530
I can go ahead and pass through this.

956
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:39,929
In fact,

957
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,979
once I do that.

958
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,570
And click on Connect to site we'll see even more output at the bottom

959
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,219
and a whole bunch of output that's kind of overwhelming.

960
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,810
Notice that bottom left here,

961
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:54,899
just going to safetyschool.org resulted in 61 HTTP requests,

962
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:55,419
in effect,

963
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:58,449
61 envelopes going back and forth.

964
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:01,850
I'm going to focus though on the ones at the very top here whereby

965
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,379
when we finally click through that warning and

966
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,659
I got back a response from the server having visited safetyschool.org.

967
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:13,056
Here is Chrome's presentation of the same information that

968
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,007
Curl was showing me in my terminal window.

969
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:18,086
The message that came back was 301 moved permanently.

970
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:21,096
The protocol or the verb being used was get.

971
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:24,497
There's some mentions of the IP address in question here and a whole

972
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:27,287
bunch of other stuff that we'll wave our hands at for today.

973
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:29,576
So all of this time you can see the same,

974
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:31,297
and let's try this with some cats.

975
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:33,927
Let me click on the little Ghostbuster symbols to clear.

976
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:36,553
Everything down in the developer tools.

977
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:43,323
Let me zoom out and this time let me go to HTTPS www.harvard.edu/cats,

978
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:46,073
which were called did not exist according to Curl.

979
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:47,154
If I hit enter,

980
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:48,864
I do see a web page.

981
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:51,553
It's interesting that Harvard has chosen to

982
00:38:51,553 --> 00:38:54,464
fairly arcanely reveal to all visitors 404,

983
00:38:54,513 --> 00:38:57,543
which means nothing except insofar as the status code.

984
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:58,253
But if I

985
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:02,381
scrolled through all of the 59 requests that were involved

986
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,041
and just displaying this very graphical page and go back to the top,

987
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,601
you'll see by clicking on the first row for Cats itself

988
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:14,160
that I used get to get it that URLs cats in the end,

989
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:16,281
and it was indeed 404 not found.

990
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:18,291
So you can sort of have all this fun on your own by

991
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:22,200
just poking underneath the hood of what your browser has been hiding from you

992
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:24,031
all of this time.

993
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:25,531
All right.

994
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,820
Any

995
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,610
questions now before we dive in?

996
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:32,229
No.

997
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,290
All right,

998
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:33,479
well,

999
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:34,949
that's the network tab.

1000
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:37,530
Let's look at some of the others and see

1001
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,000
how we can start writing this stuff ourselves.

1002
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,320
Let me go to stanford.edu enter.

1003
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,879
A whole bunch of things will fly across the screen,

1004
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:45,770
but this time I'm going to go to the elements tab.

1005
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,370
And what we're about to dive into is an actual language,

1006
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,489
not a programming language,

1007
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,679
a markup language

1008
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:51,729
called HTML,

1009
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,020
hypertext markup language,

1010
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,120
whose purpose in life is just to tell browsers what to display on the screen.

1011
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:01,580
So here is all of these so-called HTML that some humans or humans or soft.

1012
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,030
Where at Stanford wrote in order to create Stanford's homepage,

1013
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,830
which as of today looks lovely like this.

1014
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,870
The interesting thing though about the code that Stanford has written to generate

1015
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,760
this website is that it's being sent to me as a copy,

1016
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,270
and this is quite unlike the code we've been writing thus far.

1017
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,639
When you wrote code in Scratch,

1018
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,639
it was sort of there in the browser and stored on MIT's server.

1019
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,510
When you wrote C code and ran it,

1020
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,830
it was inside of the code space and not given to any user who might access it.

1021
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The way the web works though is a little bit different.

1022
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:34,110
Inside of those envelopes are literally copies of what's

1023
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,500
on the server being sent to the browser,

1024
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,899
and so it's your browser,

1025
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,179
the so-called client,

1026
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:41,340
that's actually reading that code,

1027
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,479
HTML in this case,

1028
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:43,110
top to bottom,

1029
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:43,590
left to right,

1030
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:45,340
and figuring out how to display it.

1031
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:47,979
It's not executed on the server per se.

1032
00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:51,500
Now that story is going to change a bit next week when we start using Python

1033
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:54,709
to dynamically generate HTML so that we're not writing

1034
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:57,300
all of this code by hand after this week.

1035
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,550
But for now everything you see was the result.

1036
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:04,250
Of the browser executing code that Stanford wrote.

1037
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,260
The implication of that is that we can have

1038
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,419
a bit of fun with these same developer tools.

1039
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:09,120
For instance,

1040
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,889
if I

1041
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:13,060
control click or right click on something like the

1042
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,489
word Stanford in the middle middle of their homepage,

1043
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,489
choose that same inspect option.

1044
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,699
What's nice about these developer tools is it's going

1045
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,129
to jump to the very line of code that created

1046
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,979
that Stanford brand name in the middle of the web page,

1047
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,620
and this is a wonderful teaching and learning tool because in the

1048
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,979
days to come when you're trying to learn more and more HTML.

1049
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,129
You can literally do this for any website on the

1050
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:35,320
internet and understand how it is someone implemented a design,

1051
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:35,729
for instance,

1052
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,409
that you really like and you can learn

1053
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,439
from other websites how they've constructed the same.

1054
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:43,330
So over here you'll see that the word Stanford is just

1055
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,300
in the source code of this page in the so-called HTML,

1056
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,409
and you know just for fun I can change it to Harvard,

1057
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,280
hit enter,

1058
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,360
and now Stanford's website looks like we've been there and rather hacked it.

1059
00:41:53,689 --> 00:41:56,620
Of course it's not that easy to hack Stanford's website.

1060
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:59,370
What have I presumably only done just now?

1061
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,520
I've changed my local copy of that particular website,

1062
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,270
so if I just click on the reload icon,

1063
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,070
I'll actually see that Wes Stanford's website,

1064
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,800
for better or for worse,

1065
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:11,840
still looks like that.

1066
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,159
But this speaks to now the control that we have within our browser to

1067
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,760
actually manipulate and learn from what it is that's going on underneath the hood.

1068
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,929
So let's dive into this language called HTML,

1069
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,229
hypertext Markup Language.

1070
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,389
It's not a programming language,

1071
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:27,320
which means we're going to fly through it even quicker than

1072
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,560
usual because it really just contains some basic building blocks.

1073
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:33,512
They do have some interesting intellectual design under them,

1074
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,262
but for the most part it becomes an exercise ultimately

1075
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,123
and just like looking up other tags that exist,

1076
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:40,083
read the documentation and figure out how you can

1077
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,423
use them to do other features and websites.

1078
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:44,373
So let's take a look at perhaps the simplest of

1079
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:47,903
webpage and specifically glean from them what tags are and

1080
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:50,322
what attributes are really the only two terms of art

1081
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:52,512
that are going to be geane for this particular language.

1082
00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:53,123
No loops,

1083
00:42:53,163 --> 00:42:53,722
no conditionals,

1084
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:53,962
no.

1085
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:58,186
Variables no complexity really other than basic building blocks like these.

1086
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:01,916
So here is HTML for the simplest of websites.

1087
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,525
This is like a mini version of what

1088
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:06,186
Stanford's team presumably wrote on their server,

1089
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:09,555
but it's only like a dozen lines of code instead of hundreds or thousands,

1090
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:11,345
however long that website was.

1091
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,105
Any webpage written today,

1092
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:15,115
assuming it's using the latest version of HTML,

1093
00:43:15,156 --> 00:43:16,516
which happens to be version 5,

1094
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:17,315
as of today.

1095
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,959
begins with

1096
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,139
code that looks like this.

1097
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,870
This kind of code will presumably be stored in a file called file.

1098
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,899
HTML,

1099
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,510
index.html,

1100
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:28,550
Stanford.html,

1101
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,179
whatever the file is actually named,

1102
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,290
this is simply what's going to be inside of the contents.

1103
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:35,540
You could save this file on your own Mac,

1104
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:36,149
open it up,

1105
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,500
and your browser would open it,

1106
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:40,709
but you're going to be the only one in the world that can actually see the

1107
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:43,790
contents of that webpage if it's just on your Mac or just on your PC.

1108
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,969
So we of course are going to be writing HTML on

1109
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:49,449
a server so that not just you but in theory,

1110
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,649
especially for your final project,

1111
00:43:50,979 --> 00:43:54,129
anyone in the world with an internet connection can access the same.

1112
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,550
So we within the context of CS50.dev are going

1113
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,229
to start using this new command HTTP Server,

1114
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,909
whose purpose in life is just to serve up files via HTTP.

1115
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:08,979
Now there's kind of an interesting design going on here because if we use

1116
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:09,750
HT,

1117
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,030
if we use CS50.dev,

1118
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:14,139
otherwise known as GitHub code spaces,

1119
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,750
there's already a web server running on that website because when

1120
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,389
you go to CS50.dev and log in and get redirected.

1121
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:22,852
It some longer URL,

1122
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:24,822
you're using a web application,

1123
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:28,011
aka VS code that allows you to write code in the cloud.

1124
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:32,501
Now that application by default is running on Port 80 and 443,

1125
00:44:32,622 --> 00:44:35,221
so it doesn't matter if you start at HTP or HDPS.

1126
00:44:35,261 --> 00:44:36,132
Both will work,

1127
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:36,931
but

1128
00:44:37,181 --> 00:44:41,662
that means that your code that we write today and you write for the next problem

1129
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:47,021
set or for your final project can't live at Port 80 or Port 443 because GitHub,

1130
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:48,211
the company that hosts this.

1131
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,854
is already using those default standard ports,

1132
00:44:50,934 --> 00:44:52,813
but we can use any number of other port numbers.

1133
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:53,493
I claimed earlier.

1134
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,884
There's 10s of thousands of numbers that we could use.

1135
00:44:56,134 --> 00:44:57,763
So that's what we're actually going to do.

1136
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,164
So let me go back to VS code here.

1137
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:02,684
Let me shrink down my terminal window.

1138
00:45:02,894 --> 00:45:05,563
Let me create a first file today called,

1139
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:06,364
for instance,

1140
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:08,684
hello.html.

1141
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:09,404
Enter,

1142
00:45:09,563 --> 00:45:11,384
and now I've got an empty tab as usual.

1143
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:15,174
I'm going to very quickly whip up the exact same contents that we just saw,

1144
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:18,986
so Angled bracket and exclamation point doc type HTML,

1145
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:21,676
then open bracket HTML close bracket,

1146
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:24,246
and notice the autocomplete kicked in for this particular

1147
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:26,315
language so I don't have to type everything myself

1148
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:27,885
inside of this tag,

1149
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:28,365
so to speak.

1150
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:32,186
I'm now going to put a head tag inside of which is going to be a title tag.

1151
00:45:32,285 --> 00:45:34,246
I'm going to say something like hello title,

1152
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:35,075
just to be quick,

1153
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:37,686
and then down here below those lines,

1154
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:40,125
I'm gonna put a so-called body tag inside of

1155
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,555
which is hello body just for some quick text,

1156
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:43,645
and that's it.

1157
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,239
This is now a file inside of my code space,

1158
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,340
and there's no command to just compile or run this in the terminal because

1159
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,560
the goal is going to be to open this HTML file with a browser.

1160
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,810
If I want to do that in another browser tab,

1161
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,760
I need to tell

1162
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,729
codes my code space to serve that file via HTTP.

1163
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:07,379
So the simplest way to do this is as follows HTTP server enter.

1164
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,000
You're going to see a whole bunch of text on the screen.

1165
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:11,280
You're going to see a green button.

1166
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,180
Pop up that says open and browser,

1167
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,821
which is going to allow you to open up

1168
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:17,930
and I'll zoom in the contents of the current folder

1169
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:19,460
with a web browser.

1170
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:22,891
My URL has changed to be different from what it was a moment ago.

1171
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:26,200
I came in advance today with my own folder of code like we usually do,

1172
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:26,781
Source 8,

1173
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:28,801
which contains all of today's pre-made examples.

1174
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,131
But here is the file I just created a moment ago.

1175
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:33,490
And if I click on that,

1176
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,851
hello.

1177
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:34,891
HTML,

1178
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:37,460
what we're looking at at the moment is just a directory listing,

1179
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,781
a directory index of all.

1180
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:40,582
The files in my code space right now.

1181
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:42,862
I see the simplest of web pages.

1182
00:46:42,872 --> 00:46:43,981
It's a little underwhelming,

1183
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:45,741
but clearly here's Hello Body,

1184
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:48,142
which takes up like 95% of the screen,

1185
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:49,092
the so-called viewport,

1186
00:46:49,112 --> 00:46:51,382
which is just a big rectangular region of the screen,

1187
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:53,902
but there's the title in the tab up there.

1188
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,072
So if you've ever wondered or cared like where

1189
00:46:56,072 --> 00:46:57,701
does the content in the webpage come from,

1190
00:46:57,872 --> 00:46:58,011
well,

1191
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,302
here's the body content,

1192
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:01,862
here's the head or the title content,

1193
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:05,011
and then everything else is just sort of icing on the cake.

1194
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:08,072
So I've written at Point a file called hello.

1195
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:09,202
HTML.

1196
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:11,762
It has yielded this effect of having something in the

1197
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,702
head in the head of the page in the body,

1198
00:47:14,923 --> 00:47:16,893
but let's actually tease apart what just happened.

1199
00:47:17,123 --> 00:47:19,923
So at the start of any file written in this language called HTML,

1200
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:20,923
the latest version thereof,

1201
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:21,433
5,

1202
00:47:21,643 --> 00:47:22,843
it literally just starts with this,

1203
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:25,373
and this is just the kind of thing you memorize or copy paste.

1204
00:47:26,163 --> 00:47:29,123
O bracket doc type HTML,

1205
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:30,913
close bracket over there.

1206
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:33,562
It looks a little bit different because we're not going to use.

1207
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,174
For the most part,

1208
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:37,894
the exclamation point syntax anywhere else unless we're using an HTML comment.

1209
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:39,964
So HTML has comments just like Python,

1210
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:40,474
C,

1211
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:41,523
and other languages.

1212
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:43,843
But let's focus really on this juicier part.

1213
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,083
Here we have

1214
00:47:45,293 --> 00:47:48,573
what's known as an element in HTML.

1215
00:47:48,773 --> 00:47:52,283
An element includes a start tag and an end tag,

1216
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:55,204
or equivalently an open tag and a closed tag.

1217
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:58,563
So here for instance is syntax that essentially is going to tell

1218
00:47:58,563 --> 00:48:00,894
the browser when my browser reads this file top to bottom left.

1219
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:01,225
Right,

1220
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:02,175
hey browser,

1221
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,514
here comes the HTML of my page,

1222
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:07,254
and the language in which the contents of this page are written

1223
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:08,695
are in English.

1224
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:09,794
So HTML,

1225
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:10,705
all lowercase,

1226
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:12,925
is the name of the tag,

1227
00:48:13,104 --> 00:48:13,584
so to speak,

1228
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,215
and equivalently the name of the element.

1229
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:17,544
Lang is what's going to be called an attribute,

1230
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:20,475
which just modifies the default behavior of the

1231
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:21,014
element,

1232
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:21,955
and quote unquote

1233
00:48:22,344 --> 00:48:23,425
is the value thereof,

1234
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:25,215
which is the shorthand notation for English,

1235
00:48:25,245 --> 00:48:28,225
and there's shorthand notations for most every human language as well.

1236
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:32,540
So you have a tag name and an attribute with a value,

1237
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,570
and we've seen these things so many times,

1238
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:37,979
these key value pairs in the context of dictionaries

1239
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:40,699
or hash tables or any number of other contexts.

1240
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,439
Key value pairs in HTML are separated by an equal

1241
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:46,300
sign with the value typically quoted in this way.

1242
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,340
Double quotes or single quotes,

1243
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:48,449
but being consistent.

1244
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:51,020
Then notice at the end of this file,

1245
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,219
as per the indentation.

1246
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:55,340
There's something symmetrically down here that has the effect

1247
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,739
of closing the tag or ending the tag,

1248
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,100
and this effectively tells the browser,

1249
00:48:59,139 --> 00:48:59,620
he browser,

1250
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,270
that's it for my HTML.

1251
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:01,989
Meanwhile,

1252
00:49:02,379 --> 00:49:06,340
everything else follows the similar paradigm inside of those two tags.

1253
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:07,850
Here is a head tag that says,

1254
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,300
Hey browser,

1255
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,219
here comes the head of my page.

1256
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,050
Hey browser,

1257
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,580
that's it for the head of the page.

1258
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,459
Hey browser,

1259
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,260
inside of the head,

1260
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,250
here comes the title.

1261
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,919
That's it for the title.

1262
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:16,139
Well,

1263
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:17,010
what is the title?

1264
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,090
Hello title,

1265
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:19,719
just as I wrote in my code space.

1266
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:20,699
Same story for body.

1267
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,209
Hey browser,

1268
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,409
here comes the body of the page,

1269
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:24,199
the 95% of the screen.

1270
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:25,250
That's it for the body.

1271
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,649
But what's in the body is exactly that.

1272
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,649
The indentation is nice and pretty printed.

1273
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:31,639
I've used 4 spaces as we commonly do,

1274
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:33,330
not strictly necessary.

1275
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:33,699
In fact,

1276
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,050
in my own code space,

1277
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,169
I didn't even bother putting these on 3 separate lines.

1278
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,320
I just did one line.

1279
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:40,840
That's fine because as we'll see,

1280
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:42,969
browsers typically ignore white.

1281
00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:43,615
Space,

1282
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,266
but I've done it there as we often do just to ensure

1283
00:49:47,266 --> 00:49:50,795
that things are pretty printed and therefore readable by us humans.

1284
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:53,236
Let me call your attention to one other thing on the screen.

1285
00:49:53,436 --> 00:49:54,635
Up until now,

1286
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:55,555
before every lecture,

1287
00:49:55,635 --> 00:49:59,385
I've been hiding a whole bunch of tabs in my terminal window,

1288
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:03,105
but today I left enabled one that you've probably seen but not cared about before,

1289
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:04,335
namely ports,

1290
00:50:04,516 --> 00:50:06,436
and it's under this ports tab that you can

1291
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,025
actually see a real incarnation of a TCP port.

1292
00:50:10,305 --> 00:50:10,946
By default,

1293
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:13,102
when you On the command HTTP server,

1294
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:17,102
it serves up my current folder's content on its own web server,

1295
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,652
its own HTTP server,

1296
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:21,781
but not using the default port 80 or 443 because

1297
00:50:21,781 --> 00:50:25,572
GitHub is already using those on CS50.dev and their product,

1298
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:26,412
but

1299
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:29,931
by default we've chosen another common developer port number,

1300
00:50:30,062 --> 00:50:30,781
8080,

1301
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:33,622
which is interesting only insofar as it's 80 twice,

1302
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:34,852
but it's a human convention,

1303
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,731
but it could have been any number of thousands of other possibilities.

1304
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,501
But this line here is just telling me.

1305
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:39,840
That

1306
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,629
I am some apparently running a server on Port 8080,

1307
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,860
and if I click on there too,

1308
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:46,820
I can manually open the same tab,

1309
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,699
but that's what the green button was doing for me.

1310
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,659
It was informing me,

1311
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:50,050
hey,

1312
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,290
you've just started a web server on this port.

1313
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:54,030
Do you want to open a new tab

1314
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:56,129
with the contents thereof.

1315
00:50:57,649 --> 00:50:58,909
So

1316
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,139
this is the picture we're now painting.

1317
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,439
Let me pull back up the code

1318
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:04,760
that we just wrote

1319
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,530
and let me propose that.

1320
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,379
What we've really done is build a tree in the browser's memory.

1321
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:11,209
So we kind of have come full circle with week

1322
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:14,090
5 when we talk about trees and other hierarchical structures.

1323
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:17,129
If we assume that the document can be represented with a node that looks

1324
00:51:17,129 --> 00:51:19,929
a bit like an oval up here that just represents the whole content.

1325
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:20,635
The file.

1326
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:20,926
Well,

1327
00:51:20,936 --> 00:51:23,486
it starts with a single root element by convention,

1328
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:24,605
the HTML element,

1329
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:27,325
and your page can have only one of those elements,

1330
00:51:27,486 --> 00:51:30,375
but the HTML tag inside of it can be a head tag

1331
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:31,555
and a body tag.

1332
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:32,395
And in this case,

1333
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:36,166
the head tag recall had a title tag as well as the actual text thereof,

1334
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,315
which was hello title.

1335
00:51:37,446 --> 00:51:37,756
Meanwhile,

1336
00:51:37,766 --> 00:51:40,035
the body had just the text thereof as well.

1337
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:43,291
And so when I keep saying That the browser is downloading the file,

1338
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:43,852
for instance,

1339
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:45,582
hello.html reading it top to bottom,

1340
00:51:45,662 --> 00:51:46,211
left to right,

1341
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:47,572
it's doing literally that,

1342
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:51,531
but somehow or other it's using Mao or whatever language it's written in

1343
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:52,941
to allocate node,

1344
00:51:53,052 --> 00:51:53,422
node,

1345
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:53,822
node,

1346
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,221
node,

1347
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:54,731
node,

1348
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:58,132
and populating that tree in your browser's

1349
00:51:58,382 --> 00:51:59,681
memory or RAM,

1350
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:02,132
a data structure quite like that.

1351
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:04,612
So it's all sort of germane to where we've been

1352
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:05,991
before.

1353
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:08,669
Before now we take

1354
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,750
I think a snack.

1355
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,510
Are there any questions?

1356
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,739
About what we've just seen

1357
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:17,179
Anything at all

1358
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,739
shouldn't have prefaced this with the only thing between us

1359
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,290
is uh these questions and snacks.

1360
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:23,439
No,

1361
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:23,760
right,

1362
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,280
snack time.

1363
00:52:24,469 --> 00:52:24,520
All right,

1364
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,189
see you in 10,

1365
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:25,750
snacks.

1366
00:52:28,149 --> 00:52:28,159
All

1367
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,649
right,

1368
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,370
so

1369
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,419
we are back and pretty much everything we do

1370
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:36,889
here on out will look structurally like this,

1371
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:40,239
and we're just going to introduce a few more tags and a few more attributes to give

1372
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,370
you a sense of some of the basic building blocks of most any website out there,

1373
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,580
and you'll find pretty quickly that it starts to get kind of tedious writing it out.

1374
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:47,860
In fact,

1375
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:50,969
I will resort to some copy paste today just to kind of speed things up,

1376
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,860
but this is going to motivate indeed next week when we reintroduce Python as well.

1377
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:55,666
SQL

1378
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,037
to actually automate automate generation of HTML as well.

1379
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:04,047
So all of today's websites and many of today's mobile apps are written in HTML,

1380
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:07,777
but people are in decreasingly writing this kind of stuff by hand.

1381
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:08,146
Rather,

1382
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:11,306
they are writing code that generates precisely what we're going to learn.

1383
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:14,747
So understanding the fundamentals will still be useful so we know what code to write

1384
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:16,316
next week and beyond.

1385
00:53:16,477 --> 00:53:19,954
So let me go back into VS code here and what Going to go ahead and do is

1386
00:53:19,954 --> 00:53:22,023
open up another terminal window so that I can

1387
00:53:22,023 --> 00:53:25,333
leave HTP server running in this first terminal window.

1388
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:27,904
And what I'm going to go ahead and propose that we do is

1389
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,874
implement a web page that has not just a single line of text,

1390
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:32,253
but maybe some paragraphs.

1391
00:53:32,303 --> 00:53:33,894
So I'm going to call this paragraphs.

1392
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:34,833
HTML.

1393
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:36,424
That's going to open up a new tab.

1394
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:38,374
And here's where I'm going to save some time.

1395
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:39,513
I'm going to go back to hello.

1396
00:53:39,704 --> 00:53:42,224
HTML and just highlight all and copy paste.

1397
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,950
This is the beginning of this file,

1398
00:53:44,051 --> 00:53:45,650
but what I'll start doing is just changing the

1399
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,770
title of each page to match the file name.

1400
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,881
So this is going to be my paragraph's example.

1401
00:53:50,051 --> 00:53:51,690
And instead of saying just hello body,

1402
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,561
let's actually have a few paragraphs of text.

1403
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,811
I'd rather not waste time writing even full paragraphs of text.

1404
00:53:56,891 --> 00:53:58,281
So let's actually open up the dock

1405
00:53:58,571 --> 00:54:02,520
and let's log in and for instance just ask it for a quick helping hand here,

1406
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,841
write three paragraphs about.

1407
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:07,760
Uh,

1408
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:09,229
computer science,

1409
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,570
don't really care what the output is.

1410
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,050
All I want is some dynamically generated text to save me some keystrokes,

1411
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,850
and here we have an educational answer there too,

1412
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:21,750
even though all we really care about today is the fact that this is 3 chunks of text.

1413
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:23,790
Hopefully that's all quite accurate.

1414
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,110
All right,

1415
00:54:24,189 --> 00:54:27,870
I'm going to go ahead and highlight all of that and go back into my paragraphs.

1416
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:28,979
HTML tab,

1417
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:30,500
paste it inside of the body.

1418
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:31,459
It's so long,

1419
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,189
the paragraphs that the text scrolls.

1420
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,780
I can at least clean this up slightly.

1421
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,229
I'm going to go ahead and just indent it

1422
00:54:36,229 --> 00:54:38,149
twice just so that at least it's pretty printed.

1423
00:54:38,294 --> 00:54:40,754
Inside of the body and now I'm going to go back

1424
00:54:40,754 --> 00:54:43,604
to my other tab which represents the contents of hello.

1425
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:44,284
HTML.

1426
00:54:44,524 --> 00:54:46,125
I'm going to click back which is going to show me

1427
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:48,995
that same directory listing again which now has a new file,

1428
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:49,764
paragraphs.

1429
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:50,485
HTML,

1430
00:54:50,524 --> 00:54:54,254
and I'm going to click it so as to see these three paragraphs of text.

1431
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,909
What looks wrong?

1432
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,129
Yeah.

1433
00:54:59,050 --> 00:54:59,889
There's no paragraphs.

1434
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,409
It's just one big blob of text.

1435
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,679
It's the same text,

1436
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,530
but buried in there is the end of the first paragraph

1437
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,929
and the start of the next and same for the third.

1438
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,209
So what's going on?

1439
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:09,489
Well,

1440
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,889
apropos of my comment earlier about browsers not really caring about whitespace,

1441
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:15,429
you can put all the white space you want there.

1442
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:18,120
It's just going to ignore it in this particular case.

1443
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:20,090
All it's going to give me minimally is a

1444
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,600
single space between each of these paragraphs of text.

1445
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:22,879
So.

1446
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:23,951
is very pedantic.

1447
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:26,592
Like if you want there to be more paragraphs,

1448
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:27,761
you need to tell the browser,

1449
00:55:27,882 --> 00:55:28,791
Put a paragraph here,

1450
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:29,941
put a paragraph there.

1451
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,181
And the way to do this thankfully isn't all that hard.

1452
00:55:32,392 --> 00:55:37,231
I'm going to go inside of the body here and I'm going to simply open a tag called O P

1453
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:38,941
for paragraph for short.

1454
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:41,031
Notice that VS code in this particular case is a

1455
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:42,902
little annoying because it's trying to finish my thought,

1456
00:55:43,112 --> 00:55:45,041
but it doesn't know that I already wrote this text,

1457
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:47,112
so I'm just going to delete what it automatically.

1458
00:55:47,573 --> 00:55:50,493
and then I'm going to manually indent this and I'm going to do the same

1459
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:54,003
thing again for the other paragraphs up here I'm going to open the paragraph tag.

1460
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:58,884
I'm going to delete temporarily the close tag so that I can actually put it below

1461
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:00,483
that chunk of text here,

1462
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:01,563
indent this,

1463
00:56:01,854 --> 00:56:03,204
and then down here,

1464
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,563
and this would have been easier if I just did it right the first time,

1465
00:56:05,694 --> 00:56:09,013
I'm going to do the same thing with the 3rd and final paragraph.

1466
00:56:09,214 --> 00:56:11,374
So now what we in effect have 3 times in a.

1467
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:12,355
Hey browser,

1468
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:13,476
here comes a paragraph.

1469
00:56:13,716 --> 00:56:14,565
Then the first paragraph,

1470
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:15,196
Hey browser,

1471
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:16,156
that's it for the paragraph.

1472
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:16,635
Hey browser,

1473
00:56:16,676 --> 00:56:17,496
here comes a paragraph.

1474
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:18,516
That's it for the paragraph.

1475
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:19,615
Hey browser comes a paragraph.

1476
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,785
So 3 times in total with open,

1477
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,075
close,

1478
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:22,426
open,

1479
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:22,716
close,

1480
00:56:22,795 --> 00:56:23,105
open,

1481
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:23,585
close.

1482
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:25,156
Now if I go back to the browser,

1483
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:26,395
nothing appears to have changed yet,

1484
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:28,236
but that's because I'm looking at a copy that

1485
00:56:28,236 --> 00:56:31,065
was downloaded a moment ago in that virtual envelope.

1486
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:32,145
So this is why,

1487
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:32,916
among other reasons,

1488
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,555
we hit reload on web pages to get the latest version.

1489
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:36,439
And voila,

1490
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,100
now we have 3 actual paragraphs.

1491
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,520
The white space is inserted automatically by the browser,

1492
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,560
but it's at least prettier to the eye

1493
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:44,389
now.

1494
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,969
So that then is the paragraph tag.

1495
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,840
So useful,

1496
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:48,120
of course,

1497
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:49,199
if we have paragraphs of text,

1498
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,189
what are some other tags we might introduce?

1499
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:51,399
Well,

1500
00:56:51,479 --> 00:56:54,080
maybe you're writing a paper or a blog post or the like.

1501
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,919
It's pretty typical to want headings of sections of the page,

1502
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,469
maybe chapters and then sections and then subsections or the like.

1503
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:02,229
HTML can help with this too.

1504
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,669
So let me go into my terminal window again.

1505
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,060
Create a file called how about

1506
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,929
uh let's call it headings.

1507
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,000
HTML

1508
00:57:10,379 --> 00:57:13,459
and then in this file let me similarly go back to hello.

1509
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,260
HTML,

1510
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:15,649
copy paste it

1511
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,459
into headings.

1512
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,489
I'm gonna close paragraphs because we're done with that,

1513
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,169
and I'm just gonna change the title now to headings

1514
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:25,010
and inside of the body here what I'm gonna go ahead and do is,

1515
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,239
uh,

1516
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:25,459
you know,

1517
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,219
it would have been nice to have some of that same text.

1518
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:27,340
Let's.

1519
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,030
Let me go back one step.

1520
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,909
Let me grab the paragraphs

1521
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,469
and paste that into this new file.

1522
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:36,790
Let me rename it to headings to make clear which file we're in.

1523
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,239
And now let me go ahead and propose that wouldn't it be

1524
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,379
nice if I made clear that this is the first paragraph?

1525
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:42,989
So I'm going to use the H1 tag,

1526
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:44,679
which is the heading 1 tag,

1527
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,879
and I'm just going to say 1 for the sake of discussion.

1528
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,919
Down here I'm gonna say H2 and say 2 for the sake.

1529
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,979
Discussion and down here H33 because I don't

1530
00:57:52,979 --> 00:57:54,199
really care what these things are called.

1531
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,969
I just want to demonstrate the functionality.

1532
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:59,419
If I go back to my other tab now back to the directory listing,

1533
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:00,899
there's my brand new file headings.

1534
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,620
HTML,

1535
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:02,929
and it's the same paragraphs,

1536
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,620
but now you have some big bold text that looks reminiscent of the chapter heading,

1537
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:07,340
the section heading,

1538
00:58:07,379 --> 00:58:08,179
the subsection heading,

1539
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:08,770
and the like,

1540
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,459
or that you might see on a news site or a blog site or the like.

1541
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:18,360
So you've got H1 through H6 from biggest and boldest to smaller but still bold,

1542
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:20,520
and the browser decides on all of those settings for us,

1543
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,870
but it also makes some

1544
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,429
semantic clarity to me that probably the most important thing on the page,

1545
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:27,219
at least to begin with,

1546
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,429
is that H1 tag,

1547
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,879
and then everything else is like supporting paragraphs

1548
00:58:30,879 --> 00:58:33,040
or arguments or whatever the case might be.

1549
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,959
There's a hierarchy implicit there.

1550
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,610
All right,

1551
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:37,530
what are some other things we can do with web pages?

1552
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:37,620
Well,

1553
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:39,320
let me open my terminal window again,

1554
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,919
and why don't we code up how about a list

1555
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:45,199
of values because lists are everywhere on the internet.

1556
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:46,810
So let me open up list.

1557
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:49,110
HTML and then close my terminal.

1558
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:49,530
Uh,

1559
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,580
I'll go ahead and start with that same file headings.

1560
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,439
HTML,

1561
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,120
paste it into lists,

1562
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,239
change the name here.

1563
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,770
Let's delete everything I did.

1564
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:58,590
And again,

1565
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:01,260
the only reason I'm copying and pasting is just to avoid writing

1566
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,459
out the same boilerplate code again and again with the HTML tag,

1567
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:04,899
head tag,

1568
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:05,409
body tag,

1569
00:59:05,419 --> 00:59:06,129
and so forth.

1570
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,489
Let's focus on the new stuff.

1571
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:11,459
The new stuff in this example will be a list of values like the words food,

1572
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:11,949
bar,

1573
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:12,659
and baz,

1574
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,129
which,

1575
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:14,060
much like a mathematician,

1576
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,909
might go with X,

1577
00:59:14,939 --> 00:59:15,060
Y,

1578
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:15,500
Z as.

1579
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:16,254
Holders,

1580
00:59:16,504 --> 00:59:19,024
computer scientists would typically reach for words like food,

1581
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:19,264
bar,

1582
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:21,655
and baz when nonsensical placeholders,

1583
00:59:21,864 --> 00:59:25,485
and this looks like a list of three values one after the other.

1584
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:26,415
Of course,

1585
00:59:26,425 --> 00:59:28,614
if I go back into my directory index,

1586
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:30,135
click on list,

1587
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:33,135
how many list items am I going to see per line?

1588
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:34,639
Yeah,

1589
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:34,879
well,

1590
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:37,159
it's going to be just one big blob of text here too.

1591
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:38,830
It doesn't matter if it looks like a list.

1592
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,709
It is just going to be text after text after text separated by a single space,

1593
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:45,310
not the multiple lines I had.

1594
00:59:45,399 --> 00:59:45,879
So here too,

1595
00:59:45,919 --> 00:59:47,000
we've got to be pretty pedantic.

1596
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,280
If I want a list of values,

1597
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,830
I need to use a tag that conveys that,

1598
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:55,439
and the tag I'll use first is going to be UL for unordered list,

1599
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,909
which gives me a bulleted list.

1600
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,159
And then inside of this unordered list I claim.

1601
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,090
We can have a whole bunch of list items or LI for short,

1602
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:03,379
uh,

1603
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:04,250
like food,

1604
01:00:04,979 --> 01:00:06,010
like bar,

1605
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:07,379
like baz,

1606
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:09,649
or any other things that you want to put in your list.

1607
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,649
If I now go back to my other tab,

1608
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,459
reload,

1609
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,300
now you get the familiar bulleted list that you might see in any number of websites,

1610
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,649
Google Docs or the like.

1611
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:19,540
How does Google Docs do it.

1612
01:00:19,686 --> 01:00:24,236
Neath the hood while they're just using a UL tag and some LI tags inside of that to give

1613
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:26,795
you the bulleted list that's just happening automatically when you

1614
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:29,395
click the appropriate button in something like Google Docs,

1615
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:31,706
which at the end of the day is just a website.

1616
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:32,016
Well,

1617
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:33,436
what if I want to number these things?

1618
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:33,656
Well,

1619
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:34,916
if I go back to VS code,

1620
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:38,865
I could certainly just start numbering them like 123,

1621
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:39,756
which is fine.

1622
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:40,691
And but honestly,

1623
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:43,521
like computers can count and with loops pretty quickly.

1624
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:45,372
Also it's a little annoying if I want to go back

1625
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:48,052
in later and insert something between some of those elements.

1626
01:00:48,092 --> 01:00:49,961
I then have to renumber everything manually.

1627
01:00:50,082 --> 01:00:51,961
I mean this is one of the things computers are good at.

1628
01:00:52,531 --> 01:00:53,622
So take a guess.

1629
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:57,662
If I want not an unordered list but an ordered list

1630
01:00:57,922 --> 01:00:58,592
that is numbered,

1631
01:00:58,931 --> 01:00:59,961
what might you change?

1632
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,229
Yes,

1633
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:02,969
OL is a good bet.

1634
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:05,629
Let's change both the open tag and the close tag.

1635
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,320
Let me go back to this my second tab,

1636
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,020
reload,

1637
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,000
and now we have it 12,

1638
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,540
and 3,

1639
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,340
and you can actually use a whole table of contents.

1640
01:01:13,389 --> 01:01:16,129
You can use sub bullets or sub numbering,

1641
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:17,550
anything you can do in like a table of

1642
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,060
contents HTML can do for you automatically here.

1643
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:20,360
Well,

1644
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:24,500
what about tabular data laying out data in kind of rows and columns?

1645
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:24,550
Well,

1646
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,310
we can do that too.

1647
01:01:25,469 --> 01:01:27,649
Let me go ahead and open up a new file.

1648
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:28,300
How about

1649
01:01:28,469 --> 01:01:29,050
Table.

1650
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,489
HTML.

1651
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,620
Let me go ahead then in this file copy paste as before just so I have some boilerplate.

1652
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:37,979
Let's get rid of everything in the body and then

1653
01:01:37,979 --> 01:01:40,689
let's just manually whip up a little table like this.

1654
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,449
Open bracket table

1655
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:47,050
inside of the table tags I'm going to have a TR tag for table row.

1656
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,899
Inside of this table row I'm going to have a table

1657
01:01:49,899 --> 01:01:52,149
data tag which is going to have the number 1.

1658
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,870
I'm going to give myself another 2,

1659
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,739
another 3.

1660
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,120
Outside of the table row I'm gonna have another

1661
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,949
table row and I'm gonna create maybe 4,

1662
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,590
and now I'm gonna do 5 and now I'm gonna do 6 and you can perhaps see where this is going.

1663
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,719
After this,

1664
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,280
I'm gonna do 1 more table row.

1665
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:12,659
How about a little tediously 7,

1666
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:13,870
how about

1667
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:14,830
8?

1668
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,409
How about 9?

1669
01:02:18,149 --> 01:02:19,239
And then lastly,

1670
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,659
just to make it look a little familiar,

1671
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,689
final table row,

1672
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,389
how about with a TD of an asterisk,

1673
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,510
and then how about a 0?

1674
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,800
And lastly,

1675
01:02:27,919 --> 01:02:29,510
how about a pound symbol?

1676
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,229
Maybe,

1677
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,750
any guesses as to what we're making in HTML here?

1678
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:35,949
Like a telephone keypad.

1679
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,199
Yeah,

1680
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,949
so let's go back over to,

1681
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:40,729
let me close the old file back over to the browser,

1682
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,510
click back.

1683
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,590
There's my new file table.

1684
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,239
HTML,

1685
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,320
and it's not going to be very pretty,

1686
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:45,909
but

1687
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,879
I dare say that's exactly what you see when you pull

1688
01:02:47,879 --> 01:02:50,110
up the phone app and you start dialing a number.

1689
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,979
It's sort of a numeric keypad laid out automatically for me in rows and columns.

1690
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,449
Now this one's a little underwhelming.

1691
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:57,760
Let me open up a file that I made in advance of.

1692
01:02:57,879 --> 01:03:03,419
Class today in my favorites file here I'm going to go ahead and

1693
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,219
copy a premade example.

1694
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:09,510
I'm going to open up this file called favoritezero.html and what you'll see

1695
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,750
here is a slightly more complicated table still with a table tag,

1696
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,459
but this time with a Thead tag for tablehead

1697
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:18,540
and then a T body tag inside of which are all of those rows,

1698
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:21,790
and I know this just by having read the documentation and then notice this.

1699
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:27,659
Inside of the first TR in thethead there are 3 TH's table headings,

1700
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,550
time stamp,

1701
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,199
language,

1702
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,239
and problem,

1703
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,739
which might sound a little familiar when we last

1704
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:35,090
collected data from everyone via that Google form.

1705
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,350
Well,

1706
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:36,929
let's go ahead and spoil what this is.

1707
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,820
Let me go back to the directory index.

1708
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,290
There is this pre-made file favorites.html,

1709
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,449
and arguably a more compelling use of a table.

1710
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,689
Now we have an HTML table.

1711
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,929
all of the form submissions that you all clicked in with the other

1712
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:52,370
day when we were asking you your favorite language and your favorite problem.

1713
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:53,600
It's not super pretty,

1714
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:55,889
but indeed it's in rows and columns and so

1715
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:58,639
it's reminiscent of the HTML that Google is using

1716
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,840
in the actual Google Sheet software to lay out a sheet of data for you in those same

1717
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:05,489
rows and columns.

1718
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:05,790
All right,

1719
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:05,919
well,

1720
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,000
let's do something that's a little more visually interesting.

1721
01:04:08,169 --> 01:04:09,689
Let me go back to VS code here.

1722
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:10,590
Uh,

1723
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,080
close out those first,

1724
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:12,300
uh,

1725
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:13,199
those last two,

1726
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,879
and how about let's do something with images.

1727
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:15,020
Well,

1728
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,120
I brought again.

1729
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:16,929
Uh,

1730
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,719
inside of today's code,

1731
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:22,520
how about our same bridge that we keep opening up in class,

1732
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,800
and this is the week's bridge,

1733
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,129
looks a little something,

1734
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:26,010
whoops,

1735
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:27,760
looks a little something like

1736
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:28,719
this.

1737
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,639
Here though is just the raw image.

1738
01:04:30,649 --> 01:04:35,199
How could I include an image in a web page that I serve up on the internet?

1739
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:35,489
Well,

1740
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,679
let's go ahead and try this.

1741
01:04:36,729 --> 01:04:38,239
Let me close the ping itself.

1742
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:42,800
Let me copy this and create a new file called how about image.html.

1743
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:44,208
Hide my terminal,

1744
01:04:44,407 --> 01:04:45,397
copy paste that.

1745
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:47,687
just quickly change the title to image so we know where

1746
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:49,558
we are and inside of the body of this page,

1747
01:04:49,568 --> 01:04:52,887
let's go and embed that image so that we can include not just the image,

1748
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:55,157
but if we want paragraphs of text around it,

1749
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:55,958
headings as well,

1750
01:04:55,968 --> 01:04:56,208
heck,

1751
01:04:56,218 --> 01:04:56,998
maybe a table,

1752
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:58,917
any other features that we've seen already.

1753
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:00,478
I'm gonna say IMG,

1754
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:01,958
which is image for short,

1755
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:04,208
source SRC for short,

1756
01:05:04,327 --> 01:05:05,768
equals quote unquote bridge.

1757
01:05:06,048 --> 01:05:06,758
PNG,

1758
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:09,117
and then I'm going to close the tag here.

1759
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,595
Now I'm going to go back to my other tab,

1760
01:05:11,885 --> 01:05:13,226
go back into my directory index.

1761
01:05:13,315 --> 01:05:14,285
Here's my brand new file,

1762
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:14,686
image.

1763
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:15,285
HTML,

1764
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:17,006
and this isn't going to look all that different from

1765
01:05:17,006 --> 01:05:19,045
the actual image because I have no other content.

1766
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:19,535
But

1767
01:05:19,766 --> 01:05:20,835
when I click on this,

1768
01:05:21,045 --> 01:05:23,956
you'll see that there is the full screen image,

1769
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:27,696
and it's even a little too big to fit in my viewport in the body of the page,

1770
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:29,516
but we can fix something like that later.

1771
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:31,355
I've embedded in this website

1772
01:05:31,605 --> 01:05:32,916
precisely that image,

1773
01:05:33,006 --> 01:05:34,516
but I should do a little bit better here.

1774
01:05:34,525 --> 01:05:34,916
In fact,

1775
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:38,434
if the image is slow to load or if someone

1776
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:41,474
is visually impaired and doesn't know what they're looking at,

1777
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:43,323
it would be nice to have some alternative text

1778
01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:45,634
that something like screen reader software could recite.

1779
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:47,404
So there's another attribute for this

1780
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:49,993
tag specifically called alt for alternative,

1781
01:05:50,124 --> 01:05:51,313
and I can put something like

1782
01:05:51,523 --> 01:05:54,644
Harvard University to at least give the user a textual

1783
01:05:54,644 --> 01:05:56,854
description of what kind of photo they're looking at.

1784
01:05:57,043 --> 01:06:00,164
You'll also see that text if indeed the image is slow to load or if it's broken,

1785
01:06:00,283 --> 01:06:01,394
like missing altogether,

1786
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:02,164
you won't see 4.

1787
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:04,271
4 you'll see like a broken image icon,

1788
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:06,781
but at least with some explanatory text as to what

1789
01:06:06,781 --> 01:06:09,511
the developer intended you to see at that point.

1790
01:06:09,642 --> 01:06:11,791
It's not going to change at all if I reload here

1791
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,912
by going back to image.html,

1792
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:14,471
but again,

1793
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:19,592
a screen reader or an astute viewer would see that ultimately in the browser.

1794
01:06:19,882 --> 01:06:20,991
But there's something different,

1795
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:22,751
and this isn't a mistake

1796
01:06:23,402 --> 01:06:24,152
for once.

1797
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:25,231
What have

1798
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,791
I done differently but apparently not wrong,

1799
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:28,521
I claim.

1800
01:06:30,879 --> 01:06:34,040
Something new or noteworthy about this particular image tag,

1801
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:34,629
yeah.

1802
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:36,729
Yeah,

1803
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,320
there's no like closed tag.

1804
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,570
There's no like open brackets slash IMG,

1805
01:06:40,649 --> 01:06:44,169
which is the pattern we followed for every other tag like closing the HTML tag,

1806
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:45,120
the head tag,

1807
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,169
the body tag,

1808
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:46,969
and so forth.

1809
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:50,189
I just don't see any end tag here and it's just not necessary.

1810
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,449
Turns out there are certain HTM.

1811
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:53,985
Tags that can be empty elements,

1812
01:06:53,995 --> 01:06:56,675
which is to say it doesn't make semantic sense to start

1813
01:06:56,675 --> 01:06:59,145
and end an image like it's either there or it's not.

1814
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:01,875
And so some tags just don't require an end tag if it's

1815
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:04,625
sort of obvious to the browser that the image should go there.

1816
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,554
So image is one such of those tags.

1817
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:07,760
And then I noticed

1818
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,080
I'm missing the lay here,

1819
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,870
which isn't strictly necessary because I've got no textual content,

1820
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,959
but just for consistency,

1821
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,310
let me go back and put that in as before.

1822
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:16,860
Meanwhile,

1823
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:20,479
the image is exactly as it would appear in the screen,

1824
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,510
but it doesn't have to be just an image we embed.

1825
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,000
We can do something with like video.

1826
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,669
So let me go ahead and open up a file called video.

1827
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,679
HTML.

1828
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,399
Let me copy paste some of that.

1829
01:07:30,775 --> 01:07:34,426
code change this to video and instead of the image tag,

1830
01:07:34,516 --> 01:07:35,186
as you might imagine,

1831
01:07:35,275 --> 01:07:36,355
there's also a video tag.

1832
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:37,706
It's a little more involved,

1833
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:39,226
but per the documentation,

1834
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:40,426
I know I can do this

1835
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,516
video and then inside of the video tag I can actually have multiple

1836
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:46,676
sources just in case the browser might

1837
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:48,825
want different versions or different resolutions,

1838
01:07:49,075 --> 01:07:50,426
sort of qualities thereof,

1839
01:07:50,676 --> 01:07:53,996
and this somewhat confusingly is an actual tag called.

1840
01:07:54,122 --> 01:07:55,922
Source not shortened,

1841
01:07:56,271 --> 01:08:00,392
but stupidly this tag has an attribute called source which is shortened

1842
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:03,312
that equals the name of the file you want to embed

1843
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:07,112
and I came with today's examples a video file called video.mp4,

1844
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:08,941
which is a small video that you can embed,

1845
01:08:09,112 --> 01:08:11,102
and I can tell the browser what type of video it is,

1846
01:08:11,112 --> 01:08:11,781
to be clear,

1847
01:08:11,991 --> 01:08:14,541
and the convention here or content type is to say

1848
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:17,582
the type of this video is an MPEG-4 video.

1849
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:20,410
There are other features though for the video tag.

1850
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:20,830
In fact,

1851
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,680
when you see a video on a page,

1852
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:24,490
you can very often see like a play icon,

1853
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,290
a pause icon,

1854
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,669
maybe some other controls.

1855
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:27,120
Well,

1856
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,720
it turns out you can put an HTML attribute on

1857
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,189
the video tag literally called controls that will enable those.

1858
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,040
If you don't turn them on,

1859
01:08:35,049 --> 01:08:36,799
there's no way to like start and stop

1860
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,390
the video or see rather those controls visually.

1861
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,240
This way the user actually sees them,

1862
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,390
but this attribute is a little bit different from others.

1863
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,680
It doesn't actually need a value.

1864
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:46,680
It just has to be present,

1865
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,939
and the browser will know when it sees the word controls,

1866
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:49,209
oh,

1867
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,279
I should turn on the controls feature,

1868
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,600
and for good measure,

1869
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,439
especially in today's world of advertisements everywhere,

1870
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,930
if you want the video to play automatically,

1871
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:58,540
potentially,

1872
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,370
or at least not annoy the user,

1873
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:02,240
you might want to mute it by default as well.

1874
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:05,240
So another attribute per the documentation for the video tag

1875
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,959
is that you can start the video muted as well,

1876
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,450
and only when the user clicks on it might you actually start to hear something.

1877
01:09:11,788 --> 01:09:17,377
But of course these are fairly basic examples of media inside of pages.

1878
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:19,627
Let's actually do what the

1879
01:09:19,778 --> 01:09:21,979
H is meant to imply in HTML,

1880
01:09:22,019 --> 01:09:22,858
the hypertext,

1881
01:09:22,898 --> 01:09:24,207
the ability to link

1882
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:25,778
from one page to another.

1883
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:27,648
That is a feature we haven't yet seen.

1884
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:29,139
So let me go ahead and do this.

1885
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,814
And let me just for completing this,

1886
01:09:30,895 --> 01:09:31,705
let me go back into hello.

1887
01:09:31,895 --> 01:09:34,495
HTML because I completely forgot the language attribute,

1888
01:09:34,535 --> 01:09:37,055
even though that's really just there for SEO,

1889
01:09:37,254 --> 01:09:40,334
search engine optimization or for tools like Google Translate or

1890
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:43,845
the like that know therefore what language they're translating from.

1891
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:44,234
Um,

1892
01:09:44,294 --> 01:09:46,564
let me go into my terminal window here.

1893
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,229
And let's create another file called link.

1894
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,229
HTML,

1895
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,520
which demonstrates exactly that,

1896
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,459
the ability to link from one webpage to another.

1897
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:59,350
Let's go ahead here and change the title to Link so I know where I am.

1898
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,259
And in the body of this page,

1899
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:04,950
let's go ahead and create what's called a hyperreference or hyperlink.

1900
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,839
I'll encourage people in this page to visit the actual.

1901
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:08,663
Harvard website.

1902
01:10:08,783 --> 01:10:09,982
So let's do visit.

1903
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:12,583
How about Harvard

1904
01:10:13,953 --> 01:10:15,732
period just to demonstrate where we're beginning.

1905
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:18,672
If I go back into this directory index,

1906
01:10:18,942 --> 01:10:20,323
click on link.

1907
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:21,263
HTML.

1908
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,853
This of course is not yet a link,

1909
01:10:23,183 --> 01:10:24,703
so I should probably make it one.

1910
01:10:24,743 --> 01:10:24,862
Well,

1911
01:10:25,062 --> 01:10:26,342
instead of just saying visit Harvard,

1912
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,223
maybe I should say harvard.edu.

1913
01:10:28,855 --> 01:10:30,916
Back to the other tab reload,

1914
01:10:31,286 --> 01:10:34,005
and it's harvard.edu button I can click and highlight it,

1915
01:10:34,016 --> 01:10:35,226
but it's not click a bull.

1916
01:10:35,286 --> 01:10:36,686
It's not underlined like a link.

1917
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:36,965
All right,

1918
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:37,195
well,

1919
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:40,005
maybe I need to do like www.harvard.edu.

1920
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:41,715
Reload.

1921
01:10:42,045 --> 01:10:43,895
Still nothing happening.

1922
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:44,246
All right,

1923
01:10:44,346 --> 01:10:44,516
well,

1924
01:10:44,525 --> 01:10:46,636
maybe I need the full URL in the scheme

1925
01:10:46,846 --> 01:10:49,795
HTTPS call in slash and maybe the slash at the end.

1926
01:10:50,525 --> 01:10:51,445
Reload again.

1927
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:52,770
And nothing's happening.

1928
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,410
So here too,

1929
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,569
HTML is pedantic.

1930
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:57,850
Like it will not create a link for you unless you tell it to create a link.

1931
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:01,370
And the fact that when you post on social media nowadays or on Google Docs,

1932
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:03,569
things are automatically hyperlinked for you.

1933
01:11:03,689 --> 01:11:06,049
Like that's a feature implemented in code

1934
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:08,490
very often Python or JavaScript or something else

1935
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:13,799
where some human wrote code that looks for patterns in the input you've typed in,

1936
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,689
and if it looks like you've typed a URL,

1937
01:11:16,049 --> 01:11:16,290
it will.

1938
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:17,979
Automatically link it for you,

1939
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:21,089
but what are those websites doing for you automatically?

1940
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:21,620
Well,

1941
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,740
they're doing this.

1942
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:24,209
If you want to have a tag,

1943
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:26,220
a link here to Harvard's website,

1944
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:28,890
you use open bracket A for anchor,

1945
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,850
H for hyperreference,

1946
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,129
set that equal to the URL to which you want to link,

1947
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,490
close the tag,

1948
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,290
and then in between the open tag and the close tag,

1949
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:40,700
put the actual word you want to link to.

1950
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:44,120
So now if I go back to this page and reload,

1951
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,490
now I have what looked like my original attempt just visit Harvard,

1952
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:48,609
but it's a hyperlink,

1953
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,649
and this is super subtle,

1954
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:53,560
but if I hover over that underlined word which is blue by default,

1955
01:11:53,649 --> 01:11:55,569
you'll actually see in the browser's bottom left hand

1956
01:11:55,569 --> 01:11:57,799
corner where you're going to be whisked away to,

1957
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,439
even though that's all too subtle.

1958
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:04,000
But this now looks like I intended an actual hyperlink to Harvard.

1959
01:12:04,129 --> 01:12:04,410
In fact,

1960
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:06,919
I could link it to the full URL,

1961
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:09,589
but It would be a little redundant and even though

1962
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:11,830
this looks like you shouldn't have to do this,

1963
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,950
this is indeed how HTML works.

1964
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:16,459
The HRF attribute is where you're going to go.

1965
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:20,189
The text inside of the open and closed tag is what the user will see.

1966
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:21,879
So if you want them to see the full URL,

1967
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,020
you've got to put it there,

1968
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:26,660
and now I can see the full URL to where I'm being led.

1969
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:31,299
But here's where you can actually introduce discussions of like cybersecurity.

1970
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:32,899
How could this feature be abused,

1971
01:12:33,069 --> 01:12:33,830
might you think?

1972
01:12:34,509 --> 01:12:36,129
This stupid simple feature,

1973
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:36,649
yeah.

1974
01:12:40,209 --> 01:12:40,439
Yeah,

1975
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,310
you could have a display one thing but lead to somewhere else,

1976
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:45,959
and it wouldn't be that hard for the adversary who's

1977
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:48,359
maybe tricked you into visiting their web page to say,

1978
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:48,509
Oh,

1979
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,310
you're actually going to go to yale.edu instead of Harvard,

1980
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:53,149
but if I reload the page,

1981
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,029
it doesn't look any different

1982
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,520
unless the viewer is astute enough to look at this tiny little text in

1983
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,000
the bottom of the screen or just click on the link and be whisked.

1984
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,465
Way to the wrong destination

1985
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,505
that can be problematic.

1986
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:06,576
Like this is a nice ha ha sort of prank,

1987
01:13:06,945 --> 01:13:09,186
but you could certainly imagine doing this

1988
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:11,746
with like PayPal.com addresses or any number

1989
01:13:11,746 --> 01:13:13,186
of banks or anything where you're trying

1990
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:15,815
to collect personal information from someone.

1991
01:13:15,945 --> 01:13:20,056
And if the resulting website looks quite like the one you're actually

1992
01:13:20,386 --> 01:13:20,695
creating,

1993
01:13:21,226 --> 01:13:23,722
it looks quite Like the website they're expecting,

1994
01:13:23,872 --> 01:13:25,622
but is actually your copy thereof,

1995
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:28,291
it's all too easy to wage what are called phishing attacks,

1996
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:30,282
P H I S H I N G,

1997
01:13:30,571 --> 01:13:33,412
which means to lead someone to what looks like the

1998
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:36,051
real site but is not typically to get their username,

1999
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:36,571
their password,

2000
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:37,841
their credit card information,

2001
01:13:38,051 --> 01:13:38,662
or something else.

2002
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:40,602
But it boils down to just these basic

2003
01:13:40,852 --> 01:13:42,622
building blocks like this.

2004
01:13:43,412 --> 01:13:44,282
Questions then

2005
01:13:44,571 --> 01:13:47,492
on any of these building blocks that we've seen thus far,

2006
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:47,852
yeah.

2007
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:52,839
Sure.

2008
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:54,589
Um,

2009
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,229
like

2010
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:57,089
To open up like did you

2011
01:13:59,259 --> 01:13:59,430
Oh,

2012
01:13:59,509 --> 01:13:59,950
good question.

2013
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:01,229
How did I get it to open up?

2014
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,149
So let me rewind.

2015
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,919
So the very first thing we did after creating Hello.

2016
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:05,859
HTML

2017
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,339
was open a terminal window

2018
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:11,620
and specifically I ran a command which was HTTP server,

2019
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:12,830
HTTP Server,

2020
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:15,990
which starts my own web server in my code space but not

2021
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,950
on the default port 80 and 443 because that's what CS50.

2022
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:20,259
Dev is already using.

2023
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:23,709
Instead it chose by art design 8080,

2024
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,350
which is commonly used by developers when making websites.

2025
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:28,310
Then I just kind of hid my terminal because it's.

2026
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:30,259
Interesting to see constantly then,

2027
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,979
but that web server is still running

2028
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:37,169
in my code space and any time I'm saying let's go back to this tab,

2029
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,990
I am now visiting a different URL that was the result of my

2030
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:43,939
clicking on that green button which led me to my own website.

2031
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:46,509
If you ever get lost or close that tab by accident,

2032
01:14:46,589 --> 01:14:47,339
no big deal,

2033
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:50,259
if you go to the ports tab of your terminal,

2034
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:53,189
you can actually hover over this and click on that

2035
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:57,259
same URL and open up the contents of your own site

2036
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:57,950
instead.

2037
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:00,810
Fluffy meme?

2038
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:01,310
Yes,

2039
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,470
these are randomly generated names by GitHub,

2040
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:05,600
which is the company that hosts VS Code in this way,

2041
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,589
and they do this to ensure uniqueness without it

2042
01:15:07,589 --> 01:15:10,069
being some arcane sequence of random letters and numbers.

2043
01:15:10,109 --> 01:15:12,620
They concatenate random English words together.

2044
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,229
A good question.

2045
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:15,520
All right,

2046
01:15:15,759 --> 01:15:17,319
so what else can we do here?

2047
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:17,490
Well,

2048
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,819
let me propose that

2049
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,439
there's a bit more you can do with even these URLs.

2050
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:21,600
Here,

2051
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:21,839
of course,

2052
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:24,859
is the scheme and the host name and the domain and the TLD,

2053
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,040
but after the URL,

2054
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,959
things can get a little more interesting than just folder names and file names.

2055
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,390
In fact,

2056
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,200
it's quite common to see URLs that have somewhere in them a

2057
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,120
question mark and then a bunch of other key value pairs,

2058
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,160
which is this omnipresent computer science thing,

2059
01:15:37,169 --> 01:15:37,709
it seems,

2060
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,819
including in the context of URLs,

2061
01:15:39,919 --> 01:15:41,600
whereby if you want to pass.

2062
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,509
A input to a web server,

2063
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:49,240
one means by which you can do that is literally in the URL itself.

2064
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:50,410
So for instance,

2065
01:15:50,419 --> 01:15:53,370
if you visit google.com and you want to search for something,

2066
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,450
you and I are all in the habit,

2067
01:15:54,459 --> 01:15:54,729
of course,

2068
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:57,279
of just typing into a search box.

2069
01:15:57,529 --> 01:16:02,330
But how is that search box actually getting the data into Google's servers?

2070
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:02,490
Well,

2071
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:03,839
it's via these URLs,

2072
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,009
and if there's not one input but 2 inputs,

2073
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,319
the URL might be a bit longer and there might be one or more.

2074
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:13,020
Persands in the URL that just separate more key value pairs and it

2075
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:16,500
turns out we can see this in the real world as follows.

2076
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,330
Let me go back to VS code here.

2077
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,049
Let me open up a new tab

2078
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,899
and let me open up Google.com and I'm just going

2079
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:25,859
to hit enter on the shortest way of saying it,

2080
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,129
so I get to Google's home

2081
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:31,419
homepage here even though notice I ended up at some longer form of the URL.

2082
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:31,629
In fact,

2083
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:35,140
I'm going to delete everything else from the URL that's not relevant to us today.

2084
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,950
It's still forcibly coming back,

2085
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,669
so Google is somehow trying to track me by putting that in there.

2086
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:40,669
That's fine.

2087
01:16:40,799 --> 01:16:42,600
All I'm gonna do is search for cats.

2088
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:43,479
Now there's a whole bunch of

2089
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:46,040
other functionality that's clearly happening like autocomplete

2090
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,069
and it's trying to figure out what results or words I might want.

2091
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,640
I'm just gonna go ahead and hit enter.

2092
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:55,319
And this is all to say that notice if I zoom in on the URL at the top of my screen,

2093
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:57,839
it's a crazy long URL because Google probably is

2094
01:16:57,839 --> 01:17:00,839
doing a bunch of tracking and advertising and analytics,

2095
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,270
technologically none of which is relevant to us today,

2096
01:17:03,339 --> 01:17:04,229
but notice

2097
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,970
after www.google.com there's slashear,

2098
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,560
which is the path on their server,

2099
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,879
the search program that someone there has written.

2100
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,339
There's a question mark,

2101
01:17:13,549 --> 01:17:16,189
and then there is an HTTP parameter,

2102
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,339
as these things are called.

2103
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:20,189
The more precise name for key value pairers and URLs,

2104
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,060
this is an HTTP parameter.

2105
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,750
Its value after the equal sign is in fact cats.

2106
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:26,549
All this other stuff,

2107
01:17:26,589 --> 01:17:27,549
I have no idea what it is.

2108
01:17:27,629 --> 01:17:30,180
I'm going to just delete it and hit enter and it stays gone,

2109
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,109
but I still get cats in my search results.

2110
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:33,819
So this,

2111
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,910
I would argue is sort of the canonically.

2112
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:38,235
Shortest form of a Google URL

2113
01:17:38,496 --> 01:17:39,206
that's useful.

2114
01:17:39,275 --> 01:17:39,576
In fact,

2115
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:41,145
if I want to search for dogs instead,

2116
01:17:41,275 --> 01:17:42,686
I don't have to use the search box.

2117
01:17:42,855 --> 01:17:45,136
I can literally manually make my own URL,

2118
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:45,815
hit enter,

2119
01:17:45,936 --> 01:17:47,315
and if I zoom out,

2120
01:17:47,616 --> 01:17:50,246
there are Google search results about dogs.

2121
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:54,965
So this URL too is sort of the essence then of how URLs work and specifically

2122
01:17:55,215 --> 01:17:56,306
the get verb,

2123
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:59,895
which was that keyword in all caps that I claimed was inside of the envelope.

2124
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:01,602
And it's what Phyllis's browser was sending,

2125
01:18:01,642 --> 01:18:03,432
and it's what my browser has been sending

2126
01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:05,231
through all of these examples.

2127
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:07,731
But here's where things now can get interesting.

2128
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:10,401
If I know how Google's server works,

2129
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:11,711
it's back end,

2130
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:14,711
the part that knows all about cats and dogs on the internet,

2131
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:18,191
I can implement my own front end by just knowing a bit of HTML.

2132
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:21,751
So let me actually go back into VS code here.

2133
01:18:22,001 --> 01:18:23,881
Let me go into

2134
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,080
My second terminal,

2135
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:25,910
which is blank,

2136
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,229
and let me go ahead and create something called search.

2137
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,290
HTML.

2138
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,509
I'm going to go ahead and copy my original code,

2139
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,350
close the link,

2140
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:34,589
and paste it here,

2141
01:18:34,879 --> 01:18:35,830
hide my terminal,

2142
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,200
call this thing search,

2143
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:39,120
and then inside of the body of this page I'm

2144
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,069
going to make my own version of Google here.

2145
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,930
I'm going to use a form tag

2146
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:46,950
and I'm going to in that form specify an input tag

2147
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:51,680
whose name is going to be exactly equal to what I saw Google uses Q,

2148
01:18:51,799 --> 01:18:53,319
which happens to stand for query.

2149
01:18:53,649 --> 01:18:54,060
Uh,

2150
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,370
I am then going to add another one,

2151
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,200
inputs,

2152
01:18:57,459 --> 01:18:57,580
uh,

2153
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,779
the type of this button,

2154
01:18:58,899 --> 01:18:59,100
actually,

2155
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,890
let's say the type of this box,

2156
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:02,649
this input is going to be text,

2157
01:19:02,819 --> 01:19:05,649
the type of this next one is going to be a submit button,

2158
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:06,370
uh,

2159
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:07,040
and then

2160
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:07,890
that's it.

2161
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:10,950
Let me go back into my other tab,

2162
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,890
go back into my directory listing,

2163
01:19:13,029 --> 01:19:13,750
click on search.

2164
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,390
HTML,

2165
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:15,450
and this is not pretty,

2166
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,390
but it is the beginning of my very own search engine.

2167
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:19,029
Unfortunately,

2168
01:19:19,069 --> 01:19:20,459
if I type in cats,

2169
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,439
notice what happens my URL changes such that it's search.

2170
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:27,299
HTML mark Q equals cats.

2171
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,390
I know nothing about cats.

2172
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,529
I don't have a database of cats.

2173
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:30,870
I haven't done any back end.

2174
01:19:30,995 --> 01:19:32,345
Work just the front end.

2175
01:19:32,424 --> 01:19:33,854
The front end is what the user sees.

2176
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:36,875
The back end is what provides data to the front end.

2177
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:40,895
But why don't I tell this form not to submit to me,

2178
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:43,265
but let's say that it's action should actually

2179
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:49,185
be go to go to HGPS www.google.com/search,

2180
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:52,024
which is the URL that I saw in my browser.

2181
01:19:52,064 --> 01:19:53,584
I'm just inferring how Google works.

2182
01:19:53,979 --> 01:19:56,169
I'm going to be pedantic even though this is the default.

2183
01:19:56,419 --> 01:19:59,859
I'm going to say the method I want my form to use is get confusingly,

2184
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:03,890
it should be lowercase here even though inside of the envelope it will be all caps.

2185
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,930
And then I'm going to go back to this page,

2186
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,209
reload after going back

2187
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,560
and you'll see the same exact box,

2188
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,049
but when I search now for cats,

2189
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,100
submit,

2190
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:16,379
notice my URL changes to

2191
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:17,604
Google's own.

2192
01:20:17,895 --> 01:20:18,615
It's like voila,

2193
01:20:18,674 --> 01:20:21,884
like I just implemented my own Google without doing the actual hard part.

2194
01:20:21,975 --> 01:20:24,984
I've actually just done the more simple front end,

2195
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:27,134
and there's a few other things I can do here that are sort of nice.

2196
01:20:27,214 --> 01:20:29,245
I can change the type to be a search box.

2197
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:30,995
I can change the value of my button,

2198
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,345
not to be the default,

2199
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,504
which notice was submit.

2200
01:20:33,654 --> 01:20:36,294
I can say Google search and I can keep tweaking

2201
01:20:36,294 --> 01:20:38,975
this to make it even prettier and prettier here now.

2202
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,000
In my version is now a box that has uh cats.

2203
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:44,689
Notice that it's trying to complete my thought.

2204
01:20:44,819 --> 01:20:46,490
I can actually go back into the form.

2205
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:50,950
I can say auto complete equals off to turn off that feature.

2206
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,700
So now if I click in this box and um.

2207
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,839
Mm.

2208
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,709
Autocomplete equals off.

2209
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,410
Why is it still there?

2210
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:06,740
Did I forget to refresh?

2211
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:07,470
Oh,

2212
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:07,870
thank you.

2213
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:09,259
I forgot to refresh,

2214
01:21:09,509 --> 01:21:10,120
hence my point.

2215
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,189
So you always have to reload after making a change,

2216
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:14,640
and now the autocomplete feature is off and this other little thing,

2217
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,229
it's subtle,

2218
01:21:15,339 --> 01:21:17,419
but this little X that will just clear the whole thing,

2219
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:22,899
that is simply the result of having changed text to search for the type of that box.

2220
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:26,279
There's other things you can do too for accessibility or user friendliness.

2221
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:29,379
I can do auto focus here,

2222
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:29,910
for instance,

2223
01:21:30,029 --> 01:21:32,220
without any attribute or without any value.

2224
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,049
If I now reload this page,

2225
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:34,509
notice.

2226
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,323
That the cursor is automatically blinking in the text box,

2227
01:21:37,402 --> 01:21:40,763
which is a marginal change but much easier for me to now typeAs without having to

2228
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:45,433
stupidly click in the box in order to actually foreground it so I can type input.

2229
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:46,993
So suffice it to say

2230
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,163
this is not really the business that Google is in.

2231
01:21:50,243 --> 01:21:52,913
They do much more on the back end than they do on the front end.

2232
01:21:53,002 --> 01:21:54,683
But with just these basic building blocks,

2233
01:21:54,763 --> 01:21:57,913
can I implement the beginnings of the same website?

2234
01:21:57,922 --> 01:21:58,132
In fact,

2235
01:21:58,203 --> 01:21:59,272
let me do one other flourish.

2236
01:21:59,323 --> 01:22:00,833
You'll see that text box is blank,

2237
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:01,973
not clear what I might want.

2238
01:22:02,036 --> 01:22:02,465
Do well,

2239
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:06,105
there's another attribute I can use placeholder equals something like query.

2240
01:22:06,186 --> 01:22:08,016
I can at least tell the user what to search for.

2241
01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:11,076
If I reload again now I see in gray text query

2242
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:13,945
instructions so that I roughly know what now to type.

2243
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:16,746
So all of these things that you see every day on websites

2244
01:22:16,746 --> 01:22:21,306
are really as easy as just coding up some HTML like that.

2245
01:22:21,465 --> 01:22:22,746
But what else can we do with HTML?

2246
01:22:22,806 --> 01:22:22,905
Well,

2247
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:26,065
it turns out this is a topic for another longer day too.

2248
01:22:26,226 --> 01:22:28,735
There exists in computing what are called regular expressions,

2249
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:29,386
which is a fan.

2250
01:22:29,499 --> 01:22:33,219
A way of describing patterns which are quite useful when you want to validate input.

2251
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:33,688
For instance,

2252
01:22:33,729 --> 01:22:37,969
if you want the user to have to type in an email address with the at sign with the TLD,

2253
01:22:37,999 --> 01:22:38,679
and so forth,

2254
01:22:38,809 --> 01:22:41,648
it would be nice to make sure that they get a warning if they

2255
01:22:41,648 --> 01:22:45,559
try to skip that field or they mistype something in it as well.

2256
01:22:46,048 --> 01:22:50,208
With the world of regular expressions known in short as reg X's,

2257
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:54,488
you have a whole bunch of documentation here that in a nutshell

2258
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:56,769
will introduce you to some pretty powerful syntax.

2259
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:58,551
We won't spend much time on it all today,

2260
01:22:58,832 --> 01:23:00,821
but it's syntax that exists not only in

2261
01:23:01,191 --> 01:23:02,142
the world of the web,

2262
01:23:02,231 --> 01:23:05,021
but in Python and so many other languages as well.

2263
01:23:05,151 --> 01:23:07,182
So consider this just a quick crash course.

2264
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:09,981
If you want to define a pattern in say a website

2265
01:23:09,981 --> 01:23:13,102
that ensures that the user types in an email address,

2266
01:23:13,312 --> 01:23:15,472
you can use these textual building blocks

2267
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:17,171
whereby in the world of regular expressions,

2268
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:19,872
a single dot represents any character.

2269
01:23:19,952 --> 01:23:21,231
If you don't care what the character is,

2270
01:23:21,312 --> 01:23:23,782
dot confusingly doesn't represent a period,

2271
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,361
it represents.

2272
01:23:24,424 --> 01:23:28,084
Any character star represents 0 or more times.

2273
01:23:28,575 --> 01:23:30,725
plus means 1 or more times.

2274
01:23:30,904 --> 01:23:34,524
Question mark means 0 or 1 time if you want something to be there or not.

2275
01:23:34,814 --> 01:23:37,814
Curly braces with a number means this many times and,

2276
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:40,285
and you can even have a range of values instead.

2277
01:23:40,495 --> 01:23:43,854
And then you can use square brackets and some other syntax to say I want

2278
01:23:43,854 --> 01:23:47,845
the user to type in any of these characters or digits in this case,

2279
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:49,564
or you can do ranges like this.

2280
01:23:49,604 --> 01:23:51,734
I want them to type in any decimal digit between 0.

2281
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:54,487
9 or backslashd represents any digit.

2282
01:23:54,587 --> 01:23:56,797
Backslash capital D means anything that's not a digit.

2283
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:57,788
Long story short,

2284
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,388
humans over the years have come up with shorthand notation

2285
01:24:00,678 --> 01:24:04,478
known as regular expressions via which you can define patterns.

2286
01:24:04,678 --> 01:24:07,837
This is useful because if I wanted to make a web

2287
01:24:07,837 --> 01:24:10,268
page that does in fact require that someone type in,

2288
01:24:10,518 --> 01:24:10,627
say,

2289
01:24:10,638 --> 01:24:11,578
an email address,

2290
01:24:11,638 --> 01:24:13,507
I can enforce that to some extent.

2291
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:17,147
If I go back to my browser here and into VS code,

2292
01:24:17,397 --> 01:24:19,288
let me go ahead and create a new file.

2293
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:20,690
Called register.

2294
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:24,250
HTML to be representative of registering for some website.

2295
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,130
I'll change the title here real quick.

2296
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,050
I'm going to keep the form,

2297
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:30,911
but in this case I'm not going to bother with Google anymore,

2298
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,931
so let's make it a bit simpler than before.

2299
01:24:33,141 --> 01:24:34,650
And let's go ahead and do

2300
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,090
this inside of the form.

2301
01:24:37,261 --> 01:24:38,670
I'm gonna have an input,

2302
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:39,471
uh,

2303
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,780
I'm gonna have the name of this input be email because that's what I'm collecting.

2304
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,701
I'm gonna have a placeholder be quote unquote email so the user know what to type in.

2305
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,330
Um,

2306
01:24:47,339 --> 01:24:50,160
and I'm gonna go ahead here and have something like,

2307
01:24:50,569 --> 01:24:51,890
how about

2308
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,330
Uh,

2309
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:54,220
this

2310
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,299
a pattern as well.

2311
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:57,500
So actually let's say,

2312
01:24:57,649 --> 01:24:58,270
uh,

2313
01:24:58,279 --> 01:24:59,060
let's say

2314
01:24:59,549 --> 01:25:01,500
type equals text,

2315
01:25:02,109 --> 01:25:04,470
but I'm going to specify additionally a pattern.

2316
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,779
So the pattern I want the user to type in

2317
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:10,899
in between these quotes is going to be any character one or more times,

2318
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:12,229
that is to say their username,

2319
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,299
then an a sign,

2320
01:25:13,549 --> 01:25:13,930
then

2321
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,060
any character

2322
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:17,180
11 or more times,

2323
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:17,740
uh,

2324
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,470
then literally.

2325
01:25:18,589 --> 01:25:20,250
Period and we didn't see this on the screen,

2326
01:25:20,339 --> 01:25:23,149
but just like can see when you want to escape special characters,

2327
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:28,370
if you want literally a period in their input as the like the dot in Harvard.edu,

2328
01:25:28,779 --> 01:25:32,229
you can say backslash period to mean a literal period

2329
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:35,000
and then the word or the TLD EDU.

2330
01:25:35,509 --> 01:25:37,259
So I think now what this means,

2331
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:38,850
and let me go ahead and give myself a button,

2332
01:25:38,859 --> 01:25:39,629
and just so you've seen it,

2333
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,379
there's also a button element in HTML which is similar in

2334
01:25:42,379 --> 01:25:44,450
spirit to the submit button we saw a moment ago.

2335
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:46,970
Let me go back to my directory listing,

2336
01:25:47,169 --> 01:25:48,229
go into register.

2337
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:53,129
HTML and let me go ahead and just type in like Mailen as my name,

2338
01:25:53,299 --> 01:25:54,129
register.

2339
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,899
And you'll see please match the requested format.

2340
01:25:56,979 --> 01:25:57,729
So I've not

2341
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:01,580
satisfied it properly until I actually type in something like Main

2342
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:04,100
at Harvard.edu and now it's happy.

2343
01:26:04,379 --> 01:26:04,979
Alternatively,

2344
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,430
it's a little tedious to actually type in these patterns,

2345
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,220
so there are some shorthands for them.

2346
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,740
I can actually get rid of this pattern and if I read the documentation for HTML.

2347
01:26:13,149 --> 01:26:16,529
There is actually an input of type email which

2348
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:19,040
just does all of that pattern matching for you,

2349
01:26:19,209 --> 01:26:20,810
but the scary thing is that it's

2350
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:23,290
actually pretty involved to validate email addresses.

2351
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:27,009
I did a very simplified version of username at domain.tld.

2352
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:31,319
This is the regular expression that some browsers use to validate

2353
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,410
email addresses because even though mine is relatively simple,

2354
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:36,850
mailland at Harvard.edu turns out there's a crazy amount

2355
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:39,330
of syntax that is valid in email addresses.

2356
01:26:39,629 --> 01:26:41,500
And this is where regular expressions get scary,

2357
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,770
but for our purposes today,

2358
01:26:42,939 --> 01:26:43,979
they're a thing that exists.

2359
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,660
You might find them useful in HTML.

2360
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,339
You might find them useful in Python.

2361
01:26:47,379 --> 01:26:51,779
They're incredibly useful when it comes to extracting information from web pages.

2362
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:52,939
If you're analytically minded,

2363
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,560
you like the world of data science,

2364
01:26:54,649 --> 01:26:55,850
you like to

2365
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:57,890
Gather and analyze data.

2366
01:26:58,049 --> 01:27:00,500
You can use regular expressions not just to validate data,

2367
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:04,209
but to find patterns of data in actual websites or documents and

2368
01:27:04,209 --> 01:27:08,609
extract that data so as to perform operations or analysis on them.

2369
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:12,009
It's a wonderfully useful if complicated tool.

2370
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:15,439
The catch though is this Notice that

2371
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,240
here

2372
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:19,279
I'm still required to type in a valid email address,

2373
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:20,160
register,

2374
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,529
and I'm getting even more explicit information this

2375
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:24,419
time because I use the type equals email.

2376
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:27,089
The catch though with web pages is that they're

2377
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:30,020
not to be trusted insofar as this HTML came from

2378
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:33,089
the server and is downloaded onto the user's Mac or

2379
01:27:33,089 --> 01:27:35,839
PC or phone where they have a copy thereof,

2380
01:27:36,129 --> 01:27:38,970
I can open up developer tools as I did before by right

2381
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:42,129
clicking or control clicking and choosing Inspect or whatever the menu.

2382
01:27:42,436 --> 01:27:45,675
might be I can go into the elements of this page,

2383
01:27:45,795 --> 01:27:47,025
literally the HTML,

2384
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:49,125
and if I don't want to type in email,

2385
01:27:49,235 --> 01:27:52,585
I want to just type in any old text and see if I can break your site.

2386
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,025
I can just change it.

2387
01:27:54,195 --> 01:27:54,945
And now

2388
01:27:55,235 --> 01:27:56,545
there is no such warning,

2389
01:27:56,715 --> 01:27:57,425
which is to say,

2390
01:27:57,436 --> 01:27:59,596
even though you will encounter not just today but

2391
01:27:59,596 --> 01:28:01,605
over the coming weeks as you play with HTML,

2392
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,025
certain features,

2393
01:28:03,246 --> 01:28:07,036
they are not to be trusted in general when it comes to security.

2394
01:28:07,076 --> 01:28:10,516
And just like our discussion in the world of SQL and SQL injection attacks,

2395
01:28:10,675 --> 01:28:11,675
this is one of the attacks.

2396
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:14,082
Vectors if two people are working on a website,

2397
01:28:14,182 --> 01:28:15,901
one person's implementing the database stuff,

2398
01:28:16,021 --> 01:28:17,642
one person's implementing the HTML,

2399
01:28:17,742 --> 01:28:18,921
and the database person's like,

2400
01:28:18,952 --> 01:28:19,062
Oh,

2401
01:28:19,202 --> 01:28:21,852
I don't need to worry about escaping characters because we're doing,

2402
01:28:22,021 --> 01:28:24,352
we're using the pattern attribute in the HTML.

2403
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:27,981
Bad idea because it's this easy to hack a website,

2404
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:31,211
disable features that have been written for the site

2405
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:33,861
by just literally deleting them in your own copy.

2406
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:36,691
So we'll see next week how we can defend against this on the server side,

2407
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:39,131
but the point now is just not to trust

2408
01:28:39,492 --> 01:28:40,432
the user's input

2409
01:28:40,622 --> 01:28:41,142
at all.

2410
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:41,919
All right,

2411
01:28:43,049 --> 01:28:45,049
how can we be sure our HTML is right?

2412
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:45,149
Well,

2413
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,410
there's a bunch of ways,

2414
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:48,410
but one tool that's worth knowing about is

2415
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:52,879
this one here at validator.w3.org is a website

2416
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:56,660
by the group that essentially standardizes this and other languages.

2417
01:28:56,729 --> 01:28:57,589
If I click on there,

2418
01:28:57,850 --> 01:28:59,740
validate my direct input tab

2419
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:04,000
and I quickly go back into VS code and let me grab the simplest of my examples.

2420
01:29:04,009 --> 01:29:04,169
Hello.

2421
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:05,020
HTML.

2422
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,560
I can just copy paste that.

2423
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:07,865
Into their website,

2424
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,694
click check,

2425
01:29:08,904 --> 01:29:11,424
and they have written code to validate that the

2426
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,575
HTML I have written is in fact correct.

2427
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:16,064
Anything I've opened that needs to be closed has been closed.

2428
01:29:16,104 --> 01:29:19,185
I don't have any stupid typos or missing brackets or quote marks.

2429
01:29:19,345 --> 01:29:20,865
This is a wonderfully useful tool just to

2430
01:29:20,865 --> 01:29:24,294
validate that your code is syntactically correct,

2431
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:27,095
even though it might still look like a mess visually on the screen.

2432
01:29:27,265 --> 01:29:29,095
This will at least check for you

2433
01:29:29,424 --> 01:29:30,254
the underlying

2434
01:29:30,424 --> 01:29:31,174
HTML.

2435
01:29:32,529 --> 01:29:32,540
All

2436
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,240
right,

2437
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:36,879
so up until now everything I've done has been pretty boring.

2438
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:37,870
It's black and white.

2439
01:29:37,959 --> 01:29:39,350
The pages are fairly simplistic.

2440
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,600
Turns out we can take things the final mile using another language altogether,

2441
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,660
namely something called CSS,

2442
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,990
which is the second of our three languages today.

2443
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,830
This too is not a programming language,

2444
01:29:49,919 --> 01:29:52,520
although curiously they keep adding more and more features that

2445
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,029
are making it more and more like a programming language,

2446
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,430
but more on that another time.

2447
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,750
This stands for cascading style sheets,

2448
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:02,256
and whereas HTML is About the skeleton of a website,

2449
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:03,466
the structure thereof,

2450
01:30:03,736 --> 01:30:05,787
CSS is like the skin,

2451
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:07,017
the aesthetics thereof,

2452
01:30:07,046 --> 01:30:09,247
the final mile that actually allows you to control

2453
01:30:09,486 --> 01:30:11,267
the positioning of things more precisely,

2454
01:30:11,336 --> 01:30:11,937
the colors,

2455
01:30:12,017 --> 01:30:12,816
the font sizes,

2456
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:13,756
all of the aesthetics.

2457
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:16,407
It lets you do the finer touches on the website.

2458
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:17,827
And with CSS

2459
01:30:18,137 --> 01:30:18,807
we have

2460
01:30:19,216 --> 01:30:20,676
slightly different syntax,

2461
01:30:20,736 --> 01:30:23,126
but frankly it just boils down to even more

2462
01:30:23,457 --> 01:30:24,376
key value pairs.

2463
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:25,296
And as with HTML,

2464
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,617
we'll give you a taste of the basic structure.

2465
01:30:27,954 --> 01:30:29,463
Principles underlying CSS.

2466
01:30:29,604 --> 01:30:30,463
There are so many

2467
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:33,954
key value pairs that are possible that we certainly won't do them justice today,

2468
01:30:34,034 --> 01:30:37,153
but it's the kind of thing where you ultimately look it up in a reference,

2469
01:30:37,233 --> 01:30:37,713
a book,

2470
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:38,633
a website,

2471
01:30:38,673 --> 01:30:39,344
or the like

2472
01:30:39,554 --> 01:30:41,793
to pick up even more than these techniques.

2473
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:41,974
Well,

2474
01:30:41,994 --> 01:30:42,583
let's do this.

2475
01:30:42,713 --> 01:30:46,273
Let me propose that in a moment we're going to see what are called properties.

2476
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:49,113
This is CSS's jargon for key value pairs.

2477
01:30:49,233 --> 01:30:50,313
Why do we have yet another words?

2478
01:30:50,454 --> 01:30:52,193
Because a different group of humans in a different room

2479
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:53,994
came up with this language versus the other people,

2480
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:57,090
but it's just Key value pairs known as now

2481
01:30:57,090 --> 01:31:00,440
as properties instead of as attributes in HTML itself.

2482
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:03,641
There's going to be different ways we can define properties,

2483
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:05,320
and this is kind of a laundry list of some of them,

2484
01:31:05,331 --> 01:31:06,601
and we'll see them in context,

2485
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:07,280
but in short,

2486
01:31:07,411 --> 01:31:10,590
CSS is just going to allow us to slap a whole bunch of key value pairs

2487
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,971
on our HTML elements to make them hopefully

2488
01:31:12,971 --> 01:31:16,241
look prettier or be more precisely controlled aesthetically.

2489
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:20,161
So in my HTML thus far we've generally had something that looks like this.

2490
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:22,951
Turns out if I want to start using some CSS.

2491
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:23,990
I can introduce,

2492
01:31:24,089 --> 01:31:24,770
as we'll see,

2493
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:27,330
a so-called Style tag in the head of my page,

2494
01:31:27,339 --> 01:31:29,259
and inside of that style tag I can put these

2495
01:31:29,259 --> 01:31:32,220
so-called key value pairs or as we'll soon see too,

2496
01:31:32,299 --> 01:31:34,729
if I want to factor them out and put them into a separate file,

2497
01:31:34,939 --> 01:31:39,339
I can actually use a link tag which confusingly has nothing to do with

2498
01:31:39,339 --> 01:31:42,220
hyperlinks or clickable text but just links

2499
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,229
in another file in this case styles.css,

2500
01:31:45,259 --> 01:31:48,370
the relationship of which Be that of style sheet.

2501
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:51,689
This is the sort of copy paste stuff that you do where the only thing you really

2502
01:31:51,689 --> 01:31:53,450
care about is the developer is the name of

2503
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,790
the file in which you're putting your styles.

2504
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,290
All right,

2505
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:57,000
let's do this.

2506
01:31:57,089 --> 01:31:58,799
Let me go back over to VS code,

2507
01:31:59,169 --> 01:31:59,930
close out register.

2508
01:32:00,089 --> 01:32:00,689
HTML,

2509
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:03,299
open up a new file this time called Home.

2510
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:04,169
HTML,

2511
01:32:04,209 --> 01:32:08,180
and let me purport to make a simple homepage for someone like John Harvard.

2512
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:09,959
I'll copy paste my boilerplate.

2513
01:32:10,129 --> 01:32:10,479
I'll

2514
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:14,500
Change the title here just to be uh let's say

2515
01:32:14,799 --> 01:32:15,750
uh home

2516
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,609
and then inside of the body of this page,

2517
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,879
let's do the simplest web page possible for someone called John Harvard.

2518
01:32:20,919 --> 01:32:23,000
I'm gonna say here's a paragraph of text

2519
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,990
when John Harvard is going to be the person's name.

2520
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,790
Here's another paragraph of text.

2521
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,109
Welcome to my home page we'll be in the middle of this page.

2522
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:34,040
Then a final paragraph of text.

2523
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:36,959
Inside of which is like copyright,

2524
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:41,069
see about uh John Harvard down here.

2525
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:42,509
So it's a basic website.

2526
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,540
It's just three paragraphs.

2527
01:32:43,589 --> 01:32:44,279
It's not going to be pretty,

2528
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:45,950
but let's make sure I haven't done anything wrong.

2529
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,879
Let me close my developer tools,

2530
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:48,830
click back,

2531
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,149
click home,

2532
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:51,029
and there we have it,

2533
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,959
the simplest of pages for John Harvard.

2534
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,910
Welcome to my home page,

2535
01:32:53,919 --> 01:32:55,370
copyright John Harvard.

2536
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,959
Let's at least start to exercise some control over this.

2537
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,669
Let's change the font size and the alignment of the text.

2538
01:33:00,959 --> 01:33:02,140
So back in VS code,

2539
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:04,654
let's go ahead and add uh For now,

2540
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,055
actually not even a style tag,

2541
01:33:07,145 --> 01:33:08,625
but a style attribute.

2542
01:33:08,745 --> 01:33:10,895
I'm gonna go ahead here and type in style,

2543
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:15,564
equals quote unquote font size large,

2544
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:20,504
and then text align colon center semicolon,

2545
01:33:20,515 --> 01:33:21,254
and I apologize,

2546
01:33:21,285 --> 01:33:23,515
but semicolons are back in CSS.

2547
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:25,584
Then in my next paragraphs open tag,

2548
01:33:25,665 --> 01:33:30,964
let's do something similar but different font size colon medium for medium text,

2549
01:33:31,024 --> 01:33:32,674
text align colon center,

2550
01:33:32,825 --> 01:33:33,625
semicolon.

2551
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:34,169
Uh,

2552
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:35,200
and then lastly down here,

2553
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:39,729
let's do style equals quote unquote font size colon small because it's the footer,

2554
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:40,850
so who cares?

2555
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:41,729
Text align,

2556
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:42,839
colon center,

2557
01:33:43,009 --> 01:33:43,680
semicolon,

2558
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:44,459
strictly speaking,

2559
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,359
at the last key value pair,

2560
01:33:46,529 --> 01:33:47,759
otherwise known as a property,

2561
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:49,500
you don't need the semicolons,

2562
01:33:49,509 --> 01:33:50,890
but just for consistency.

2563
01:33:51,379 --> 01:33:52,129
I'll keep them

2564
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:53,129
uh for

2565
01:33:53,259 --> 01:33:53,850
for that.

2566
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:54,379
All right,

2567
01:33:54,459 --> 01:33:55,689
let's go back to this page,

2568
01:33:55,819 --> 01:34:00,689
reload and watch all of the text a moment ago was left aligned and the same size.

2569
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,259
Now it's a little subtle,

2570
01:34:02,299 --> 01:34:03,410
but it's clearly centered,

2571
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:04,299
but it's large,

2572
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:04,970
medium,

2573
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:05,729
and small,

2574
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:06,649
respectively.

2575
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:08,660
Even if you've never seen CSS before,

2576
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,850
what rubs you wrong about this design though

2577
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,029
based on all weeks past.

2578
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:14,729
Yeah.

2579
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:19,560
Yeah,

2580
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,560
for every line I've been repeating myself with text

2581
01:34:21,729 --> 01:34:22,089
line center,

2582
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:22,810
text the line center,

2583
01:34:22,879 --> 01:34:23,620
text the line center,

2584
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,080
and if we really want to nitpick,

2585
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:26,759
these aren't really paragraphs,

2586
01:34:26,839 --> 01:34:26,959
right?

2587
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,810
There's like no phrases or full sentences,

2588
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:30,439
let alone paragraphs.

2589
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:34,029
So it turns out there's a whole bunch of tags we can use to lay out a page,

2590
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,439
and in fact I'm going to transition to

2591
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:37,959
one that's a little more generic than paragraphs,

2592
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:38,839
namely div,

2593
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,709
which is just going to create a division in the page for me.

2594
01:34:41,959 --> 01:34:43,830
And this doesn't have any functional impact,

2595
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:46,040
but semantically it's a little nicer because it

2596
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,359
means I've got the division here for.

2597
01:34:47,435 --> 01:34:47,935
Header,

2598
01:34:48,024 --> 01:34:49,375
the division here for the main part,

2599
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,785
and the division down here for the footer,

2600
01:34:50,794 --> 01:34:52,225
it's just a different way of thinking about it.

2601
01:34:52,305 --> 01:34:55,055
It's just different rectangular swaths of the page,

2602
01:34:55,345 --> 01:34:57,384
but I like your point that text aligned center

2603
01:34:57,384 --> 01:35:00,334
is kind of stupidly duplicated all of these times.

2604
01:35:00,584 --> 01:35:02,785
Let me actually go ahead and first reload

2605
01:35:02,785 --> 01:35:04,984
this change because there is one side effect

2606
01:35:04,984 --> 01:35:09,044
that we might want to get back when I reload now using dibs instead of paragraphs.

2607
01:35:09,145 --> 01:35:09,194
Well,

2608
01:35:09,265 --> 01:35:11,825
there goes the nice white space in between my text.

2609
01:35:11,904 --> 01:35:14,375
dibs just give me rectangle after rectangle,

2610
01:35:14,384 --> 01:35:15,424
and as an aside,

2611
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:18,040
Let me control click or right click,

2612
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,259
open up developer tools yet again and notice

2613
01:35:20,259 --> 01:35:22,839
this other trick with your elements tab.

2614
01:35:23,049 --> 01:35:25,959
Whatever you hover over at the bottom of your screen

2615
01:35:25,959 --> 01:35:28,319
will be color coded at the top of the screen.

2616
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:31,490
So if I dive into the body by clicking this little triangle,

2617
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:33,529
let me zoom in at bottom left.

2618
01:35:33,919 --> 01:35:38,740
I can now see my own HTML much more pretty printed and colorful down here.

2619
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:40,910
If I click on this one or hover over it,

2620
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,430
you'll see that the first div,

2621
01:35:42,549 --> 01:35:43,419
the rectangular region,

2622
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:44,180
is highlighted.

2623
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:45,029
Now the second,

2624
01:35:45,109 --> 01:35:45,620
now the 3rd,

2625
01:35:45,819 --> 01:35:47,899
that's all we mean by divisions of the page.

2626
01:35:48,339 --> 01:35:53,350
This allows me to see my copy of it in the browser as opposed to in the original file.

2627
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:56,029
So just another technique for developer tools.

2628
01:35:56,189 --> 01:35:56,350
All right,

2629
01:35:56,529 --> 01:35:58,029
but I don't like this duplication,

2630
01:35:58,089 --> 01:35:59,379
but here is now the C.

2631
01:35:59,529 --> 01:36:06,149
In CSS cascading style sheets means that if you want one property or key value pair

2632
01:36:06,149 --> 01:36:10,270
to sort of cascade down on all of the other tags inside of that one,

2633
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:11,279
you can do that.

2634
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:11,750
For instance,

2635
01:36:11,759 --> 01:36:12,640
in the body tag,

2636
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:17,330
I can add my own style attribute here and put all of that text aligned center there.

2637
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:17,810
Why?

2638
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,509
Because div div div are the three children

2639
01:36:20,799 --> 01:36:22,839
of the body tag to borrow a vernacular

2640
01:36:22,839 --> 01:36:24,959
from family trees and from trees more generally.

2641
01:36:25,509 --> 01:36:25,950
So

2642
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:28,709
this too should work because Text aligned center should

2643
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:31,540
cascade down now on all three of those children,

2644
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,100
and indeed if I reload the page,

2645
01:36:33,509 --> 01:36:35,140
nothing visually changes,

2646
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,109
but it's arguably now better designed.

2647
01:36:39,209 --> 01:36:39,450
All right,

2648
01:36:39,649 --> 01:36:40,770
what more could we do here?

2649
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,229
Well,

2650
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:42,560
how about this?

2651
01:36:42,689 --> 01:36:46,250
It would be nice to make clear to servers out there like search engines,

2652
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,490
like what's going on in the page semantically,

2653
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,850
and the term of art out there nowadays is the semantic web,

2654
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:55,689
which essentially is about putting more hints in your HTML so that servers

2655
01:36:55,689 --> 01:36:59,490
like search engines kind of know more so what they're looking at.

2656
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,919
This is pretty generic right now div div div,

2657
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:04,089
but presumably the top of the page.

2658
01:37:04,196 --> 01:37:05,867
Among the most important things because that's

2659
01:37:05,867 --> 01:37:07,816
effectively like the header of the page,

2660
01:37:07,986 --> 01:37:11,347
then the middle div is kind of the second most important because it's like

2661
01:37:11,347 --> 01:37:13,937
the main part of the page and the footer is like the least important.

2662
01:37:14,117 --> 01:37:17,907
So it turns out there are other tags in HTML besides paragraphs and dibs.

2663
01:37:17,946 --> 01:37:19,497
There are literally tags like

2664
01:37:19,747 --> 01:37:22,856
header which allows me to define the header of the page,

2665
01:37:23,146 --> 01:37:23,506
main,

2666
01:37:23,586 --> 01:37:25,816
which allows me to define the main part of the page,

2667
01:37:25,827 --> 01:37:26,827
and then even footer,

2668
01:37:26,907 --> 01:37:28,497
which allows me to define that too.

2669
01:37:28,707 --> 01:37:30,764
So now if Google and Bing and other search engines

2670
01:37:30,764 --> 01:37:33,273
are sort of crawling my website once it's public.

2671
01:37:33,483 --> 01:37:34,394
They know that

2672
01:37:34,764 --> 01:37:36,673
John Harvard's important because it's in the header.

2673
01:37:37,213 --> 01:37:39,514
Welcome to my home page is important because it's in the main page.

2674
01:37:39,644 --> 01:37:40,983
They're probably not going to care as much

2675
01:37:40,983 --> 01:37:42,693
about the copyright because it's in the footer,

2676
01:37:42,724 --> 01:37:46,403
so it's just providing more hints to these kinds of services.

2677
01:37:47,003 --> 01:37:47,523
Moreover,

2678
01:37:47,574 --> 01:37:48,744
we can do some other things here.

2679
01:37:48,804 --> 01:37:51,673
This is kind of a hackish way to implement a copyright symbol.

2680
01:37:51,963 --> 01:37:54,363
HTML also has what are called entities.

2681
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:57,130
Where if I can do this magical incantation here,

2682
01:37:57,581 --> 01:38:00,851
Ampersan hash symbol 169 semicolon,

2683
01:38:01,101 --> 01:38:04,331
notice that VS code recognizes this as an HTML entity.

2684
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:06,820
If I go back to this page and notice

2685
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:10,110
my first approach was just parenthesis C parenthesis.

2686
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:11,221
If I reload now,

2687
01:38:11,230 --> 01:38:12,661
having used that HTML entity,

2688
01:38:12,741 --> 01:38:14,570
which I only know by having looked it up,

2689
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:17,920
now I get the copyright symbol that actually comes in the font

2690
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:19,420
that's being used here.

2691
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:21,290
All right,

2692
01:38:21,569 --> 01:38:23,120
so let's transition now

2693
01:38:23,450 --> 01:38:27,250
to this approach whereby I claimed before that you can actually use

2694
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,970
a style tag and why might we want to do this?

2695
01:38:30,049 --> 01:38:30,279
Well,

2696
01:38:30,419 --> 01:38:31,879
looking back at my code here,

2697
01:38:32,049 --> 01:38:35,729
this is sort of hinting at potentially bad design even though there are

2698
01:38:35,729 --> 01:38:38,890
different arguments for and against this right now I'm sort of combing.

2699
01:38:39,234 --> 01:38:40,915
my data with my presentation thereof,

2700
01:38:41,035 --> 01:38:42,035
like John Harvard.

2701
01:38:42,075 --> 01:38:46,745
Welcome to my homepage and copyright such and such is sort of the data I care about,

2702
01:38:47,274 --> 01:38:49,674
but I'm sort of mixing in the stylization of all of

2703
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:54,115
this stuff by putting CSS and HTML in the same place.

2704
01:38:54,234 --> 01:38:54,865
So to be clear,

2705
01:38:55,115 --> 01:38:57,354
all of the green stuff and well.

2706
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:59,029
Everything we've seen thus far,

2707
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:00,270
the tags and the attributes,

2708
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,540
that's all HTML syntax.

2709
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:05,859
Everything between the quotes is now CSS,

2710
01:39:05,870 --> 01:39:07,149
and this is the first

2711
01:39:07,509 --> 01:39:11,459
we've seen this before only in the sense that we've used SQL inside of Python code.

2712
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,259
Here we're using CSS inside of HTML code,

2713
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:18,470
but the CSS syntax is everything thus far inside of those quote marks.

2714
01:39:18,549 --> 01:39:22,069
Wouldn't it be nice to kind of factor that out so that I can see it all in

2715
01:39:22,069 --> 01:39:24,109
one place and better still factor it out ultimately

2716
01:39:24,109 --> 01:39:26,698
to another file and I Do this as follows.

2717
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:28,067
Let me in my home.

2718
01:39:28,268 --> 01:39:29,047
HTML,

2719
01:39:29,627 --> 01:39:32,538
get rid of all of these style attributes and really go

2720
01:39:32,538 --> 01:39:36,698
whittle the page down to its essence whereby I just have

2721
01:39:37,107 --> 01:39:37,618
the

2722
01:39:37,937 --> 01:39:38,518
header,

2723
01:39:38,868 --> 01:39:39,228
main,

2724
01:39:39,417 --> 01:39:41,708
and footer tags inside of which is that content.

2725
01:39:41,757 --> 01:39:42,908
It's already easier to read,

2726
01:39:42,948 --> 01:39:43,417
at least for me,

2727
01:39:43,428 --> 01:39:44,138
the human.

2728
01:39:44,348 --> 01:39:45,908
Inside of my head tag now though,

2729
01:39:45,987 --> 01:39:47,538
let me go up and say style,

2730
01:39:47,788 --> 01:39:49,587
and inside of this new style tag,

2731
01:39:49,667 --> 01:39:52,377
let me show you another approach for stylizing the page.

2732
01:39:52,587 --> 01:39:53,138
Up here.

2733
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:55,016
is where we can actually select

2734
01:39:55,585 --> 01:39:58,625
elements to operate on using what are called selectors.

2735
01:39:58,706 --> 01:40:01,456
So if I want to modify the style of my page's body,

2736
01:40:01,706 --> 01:40:03,375
I can do that by typing body,

2737
01:40:03,545 --> 01:40:06,395
and then I'm afraid curly braces are back in CSS 2.

2738
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,335
I can put text aligned center up here

2739
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:12,065
and the fact that I've put the word body before those

2740
01:40:12,065 --> 01:40:14,585
curly braces just means all of these key value pairs,

2741
01:40:14,666 --> 01:40:16,936
one in this case will operate on the body.

2742
01:40:17,266 --> 01:40:20,826
Meanwhile down here I can say the header is going to have font.

2743
01:40:20,974 --> 01:40:22,653
Size colon large,

2744
01:40:22,943 --> 01:40:23,144
uh,

2745
01:40:23,224 --> 01:40:27,983
the main part of the page is gonna have font size colon medium and then

2746
01:40:27,983 --> 01:40:32,253
lastly the footer of the page is going to have font size colon small,

2747
01:40:32,463 --> 01:40:32,613
you know,

2748
01:40:32,744 --> 01:40:34,104
definitely more lines now,

2749
01:40:34,184 --> 01:40:35,063
which isn't the best,

2750
01:40:35,184 --> 01:40:35,574
but

2751
01:40:35,744 --> 01:40:38,173
the effects now if I go back to my browser

2752
01:40:38,423 --> 01:40:41,604
and reload visually is pretty much the same.

2753
01:40:41,664 --> 01:40:44,733
I've just relocated all of those key value pairs elsewhere,

2754
01:40:44,824 --> 01:40:48,583
but as a stepping stone now for doing something a little smarter whereby I.

2755
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:49,341
Now

2756
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:54,461
can lay the foundation for putting this in another file altogether.

2757
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:55,051
But first,

2758
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:56,271
let me note this too.

2759
01:40:56,532 --> 01:41:00,341
The fact that I've put all of these key value pairs associated with

2760
01:41:00,341 --> 01:41:05,771
specific HTML tags doesn't really make them very usable or rather reusable.

2761
01:41:05,981 --> 01:41:08,301
And so when I alluded to earlier that these properties

2762
01:41:08,301 --> 01:41:12,021
can be applied to different selections of HTML type selectors,

2763
01:41:12,142 --> 01:41:12,702
class selectors,

2764
01:41:12,742 --> 01:41:13,301
ID selector,

2765
01:41:13,341 --> 01:41:13,981
attribute selector,

2766
01:41:14,021 --> 01:41:15,532
let's just give you a little taste of this.

2767
01:41:15,662 --> 01:41:16,341
What do we mean?

2768
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:17,000
Well,

2769
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:21,189
suppose that I want to generically be able to use

2770
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:22,750
text aligned center

2771
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:25,430
without associating it only with the body.

2772
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,120
Maybe I want to use this for a larger project

2773
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,750
where I want to center many things on the page.

2774
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,950
I can define my own keyword like the word centered,

2775
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:34,810
which doesn't exist per se,

2776
01:41:34,899 --> 01:41:36,470
but if I prefix it with a dot,

2777
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,939
what I've just created is what's called the CSS class,

2778
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,759
and a class is just a set of key value pairs,

2779
01:41:43,919 --> 01:41:44,399
properties.

2780
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:47,020
That you can associate with any HTML tags.

2781
01:41:47,149 --> 01:41:47,509
Meanwhile,

2782
01:41:47,589 --> 01:41:48,879
if I want this

2783
01:41:49,229 --> 01:41:51,629
key value pair to be associated with the notion of large,

2784
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:52,870
I can define large.

2785
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:54,189
I can define medium,

2786
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:56,419
and I can define small down here.

2787
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:59,819
The motivation for which is that now in my page,

2788
01:42:00,069 --> 01:42:01,740
if I want to

2789
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:03,399
center the body,

2790
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,830
oops,

2791
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:05,080
let me fix my own typo,

2792
01:42:05,229 --> 01:42:06,580
if I want to center the body,

2793
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:12,109
I can say please use the class known as centered on this tag.

2794
01:42:12,419 --> 01:42:17,799
And then on the header I can say please use the class known as large on this tag,

2795
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:21,080
and then please use the class called medium here and then lastly,

2796
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:23,200
use the class called small here.

2797
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:25,970
So now in the spirit of a lot of the modularization we

2798
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:28,290
did in Scratch and in seeing Python of making your own fun.

2799
01:42:28,455 --> 01:42:29,964
Classes aren't functions,

2800
01:42:30,044 --> 01:42:34,245
but they are a way to encapsulate one or more properties and

2801
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:37,604
use or reuse them anywhere you want in a web page.

2802
01:42:37,645 --> 01:42:40,515
It's not that it's not that impressive here in the short one,

2803
01:42:40,685 --> 01:42:44,515
but it lays the foundation for doing much more interesting things soon

2804
01:42:44,924 --> 01:42:45,555
down the road.

2805
01:42:45,805 --> 01:42:46,165
In fact,

2806
01:42:46,205 --> 01:42:48,404
let's take a step in that same direction.

2807
01:42:48,564 --> 01:42:49,645
Let me go ahead and

2808
01:42:49,924 --> 01:42:51,075
now highlight

2809
01:42:51,685 --> 01:42:53,765
everything I've put inside of the Style tag.

2810
01:42:54,649 --> 01:42:54,959
Um,

2811
01:42:55,029 --> 01:42:56,580
and cut it onto my clipboard.

2812
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:59,500
I'm going to get rid of the style tag altogether.

2813
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,640
I'm going to create quickly a new file,

2814
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,069
comb.css,

2815
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:06,200
and I'm just going to paste all of that stuff in there and just to be nitpicky,

2816
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:08,939
I'm going to de-inent it so it's all left aligned.

2817
01:43:09,069 --> 01:43:13,000
So all I've done is just move everything I just wrote into a new file called home.

2818
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,259
CSS.

2819
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:15,450
I'll close that out of sight,

2820
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:16,180
out of mind,

2821
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:18,100
but what I'm going to do now in the head instead

2822
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,459
of a style tag which contained all of that clutter,

2823
01:43:20,509 --> 01:43:21,799
I'm To say link

2824
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:25,890
Href equals home.css and then this rel tag,

2825
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:28,009
which just means the relationship of this file to

2826
01:43:28,009 --> 01:43:29,879
this one shall be that of a style sheet,

2827
01:43:30,209 --> 01:43:30,649
and

2828
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:33,009
this tag 2 does not need to be closed,

2829
01:43:33,129 --> 01:43:34,080
it just is.

2830
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:36,819
And now if I go back here and reload,

2831
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:40,319
still no changes other than the tweak the font a moment ago,

2832
01:43:40,689 --> 01:43:41,520
still no changes,

2833
01:43:41,529 --> 01:43:42,879
but now

2834
01:43:43,209 --> 01:43:46,890
it's better designed with that file completely separate.

2835
01:43:47,419 --> 01:43:49,310
So where are we going with this?

2836
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:49,430
Well,

2837
01:43:49,549 --> 01:43:51,830
just to kind of circle back to something we did earlier,

2838
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:53,990
let me open up my terminal window and recall

2839
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:56,950
earlier we had this file like favorites zero.

2840
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:57,899
HTML,

2841
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:59,790
and this contained all of the data from a couple of

2842
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:02,700
weeks back that we solicited via that Google form and recall

2843
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:05,029
a bit ago when we went into favorite zero.

2844
01:44:05,229 --> 01:44:05,660
HTML.

2845
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,140
I mean it was just kind of an ugly table structure,

2846
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:11,589
but it turns out in the world of

2847
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:14,160
In the world of HTML and CSS,

2848
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:16,189
there are also what we're going to call frameworks,

2849
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:18,540
which is a fancy word for library,

2850
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:23,220
but a framework is sort of a way of doing something by using someone else's library.

2851
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,629
And to do it their way,

2852
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:28,020
you just read their documentation and then you adopt their functions in the case

2853
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:32,109
of code or you adopt their CSS classes in the case of this example.

2854
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:34,270
So one of the most popular frameworks out there nowadays

2855
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,709
and among the simplest and best documented is one called

2856
01:44:36,865 --> 01:44:37,654
Bootstrap,

2857
01:44:38,225 --> 01:44:41,294
which is a set of

2858
01:44:41,834 --> 01:44:45,314
CSS classes and other features that you can use

2859
01:44:45,314 --> 01:44:47,024
because it's open source in your own code.

2860
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,384
In fact,

2861
01:44:47,424 --> 01:44:49,694
all of the documentation is at this URL here.

2862
01:44:49,944 --> 01:44:52,625
I read the documentation before class and I copied really the

2863
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:55,084
one line of code that I need to make favorites.

2864
01:44:55,334 --> 01:44:57,015
HTML even prettier.

2865
01:44:57,185 --> 01:45:01,424
So let me go back into VS code and let me copy my pre-made example from earlier.

2866
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:03,359
And you'll see that in favorites,

2867
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:05,240
whoops favorites 1.

2868
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:06,259
HTML,

2869
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,279
I have all of the same code,

2870
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:10,600
all of those lines of everyone's submissions,

2871
01:45:10,759 --> 01:45:13,990
but notice I've added now this link tag,

2872
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,640
and it's a little longer than the one I wrote.

2873
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,259
It's referencing a third party website,

2874
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:18,000
JSD Deliver,

2875
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:20,350
which is a CDN content delivery network,

2876
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,069
which is to say a server that just serves up content for other people to use,

2877
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:26,430
but I copied that from Bootstrap's own documentation.

2878
01:45:26,799 --> 01:45:30,120
And what I did here is the following I added.

2879
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:34,310
A class to my table tag specifically with a value

2880
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:37,069
of table and followed by a space table striped.

2881
01:45:37,149 --> 01:45:37,540
Why?

2882
01:45:37,629 --> 01:45:37,669
Well,

2883
01:45:37,799 --> 01:45:40,229
I read bootstraps documentation at that previous URL and

2884
01:45:40,229 --> 01:45:42,950
I liked the look of their tables because it lays

2885
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:45,080
it out with nice stripes like white and gray

2886
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,580
and white and gray and it sort of formats everything

2887
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:48,859
quite a bit nicer.

2888
01:45:49,149 --> 01:45:53,689
So if I go into this version in my second tab by going back first

2889
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:55,979
and now opening up favorites1.

2890
01:45:56,189 --> 01:45:56,759
HTML,

2891
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:57,899
same exact data.

2892
01:45:58,549 --> 01:46:01,759
Two lines of change and voila,

2893
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:02,729
now we're talking.

2894
01:46:02,859 --> 01:46:05,299
This looks much more like a table that you would see

2895
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:08,649
on any pretty website like your Gmail inbox or the like,

2896
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:12,729
all by simply changing the CSS and not really the HTML at all.

2897
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:15,939
So the motivation for introducing those classes a moment ago was

2898
01:46:15,939 --> 01:46:18,740
so that we can have reusability of code and better still,

2899
01:46:18,819 --> 01:46:21,899
we can start to stand on the shoulders of others by using code that

2900
01:46:21,899 --> 01:46:26,850
other people have written in order to improve the aesthetics of our own websites

2901
01:46:27,419 --> 01:46:28,140
as well.

2902
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:29,029
All right,

2903
01:46:29,089 --> 01:46:31,069
how about a couple of final flourishes with

2904
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:31,629
some style?

2905
01:46:31,709 --> 01:46:36,459
Let me close out these examples here and let me propose to go into

2906
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:39,350
how about that same link example from earlier.

2907
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:40,680
So let me reopen Link.

2908
01:46:40,870 --> 01:46:41,479
HTML,

2909
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,779
which recall had this phishing attack at the time.

2910
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,819
I'm going to revert this to the safe version

2911
01:46:45,819 --> 01:46:48,899
and just say visit Harvard at Harvard's actual URL.

2912
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:51,950
Suppose I wanted to stylize this link beyond the defaults.

2913
01:46:52,069 --> 01:46:52,189
Well,

2914
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:54,459
let's see what it looks like by default.

2915
01:46:54,549 --> 01:46:55,839
If I go back into Li.H.

2916
01:46:56,155 --> 01:46:56,275
Now,

2917
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:57,835
this is what it looked like before blue

2918
01:46:57,835 --> 01:47:00,465
and underlined by default for the browser's decision,

2919
01:47:00,715 --> 01:47:03,706
but I can override that in any number of ways to keep things simple,

2920
01:47:03,835 --> 01:47:06,786
I'm just going to stay in my same file now rather than

2921
01:47:07,286 --> 01:47:09,425
be pedantic about moving it to another file.

2922
01:47:09,675 --> 01:47:12,996
And if I want to stylize the anchor tag just as before,

2923
01:47:13,016 --> 01:47:14,025
I can say A,

2924
01:47:14,235 --> 01:47:17,395
and then in some curly braces here I can do something like this color,

2925
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:18,445
colon,

2926
01:47:18,596 --> 01:47:21,346
red if I want to make it crimson-like instead.

2927
01:47:21,556 --> 01:47:23,485
Let me go back to VS code or my

2928
01:47:23,591 --> 01:47:24,151
tab,

2929
01:47:24,242 --> 01:47:25,151
click reload,

2930
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:26,401
and now we have a red tab.

2931
01:47:26,521 --> 01:47:29,041
I can really geek out and if you remember your hexadecimal

2932
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:31,521
codes from our discussion of images a few weeks back,

2933
01:47:31,642 --> 01:47:34,771
I can do has FF0000,

2934
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:35,881
which is a lot of red,

2935
01:47:35,961 --> 01:47:36,361
no green,

2936
01:47:36,481 --> 01:47:37,202
no blue.

2937
01:47:37,282 --> 01:47:39,001
And if I go back to my other tab,

2938
01:47:39,082 --> 01:47:39,731
click reload,

2939
01:47:40,001 --> 01:47:40,812
same exact thing.

2940
01:47:40,841 --> 01:47:44,191
You have that much control over even the color codes that you might use.

2941
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:46,711
Maybe you don't like the underlining in this particular case.

2942
01:47:46,762 --> 01:47:46,852
Well,

2943
01:47:46,881 --> 01:47:47,361
that's fine.

2944
01:47:47,441 --> 01:47:48,812
I can do something like text

2945
01:47:49,082 --> 01:47:50,071
decoration,

2946
01:47:50,361 --> 01:47:50,841
none.

2947
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:55,569
Per the documentation I can reload and gone is that underline.

2948
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:58,410
Maybe it'd be nice to hover over the word and then see the underline.

2949
01:47:58,439 --> 01:47:58,479
Well,

2950
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,470
I can do that too.

2951
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:03,069
Turns out I can have these pseudo selectors whereby I say the name of the tag,

2952
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:04,569
then a keyword like hover,

2953
01:48:04,759 --> 01:48:06,669
which browsers know to recognize,

2954
01:48:06,799 --> 01:48:08,399
and when I hover over an anchor,

2955
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:13,589
what I want to do is change the text decoration to underline temporarily.

2956
01:48:13,799 --> 01:48:15,319
If I go back to this tab now.

2957
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:17,370
Reload looks the same,

2958
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:19,069
but as I move my cursor over,

2959
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:22,120
notice that it's underlining it for a visual effect.

2960
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:24,209
Let's see what's going on with my developer tools.

2961
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:26,129
If I right click anywhere and choose inspect,

2962
01:48:26,609 --> 01:48:31,520
notice a detail I haven't showed us before is not uh is under the elements tab here.

2963
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:34,410
Notice if I go down to my link here and let

2964
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:36,720
me just make the right hand pane here a bit bigger.

2965
01:48:37,009 --> 01:48:39,649
All this time but ignored up until now has been.

2966
01:48:39,775 --> 01:48:41,636
This part of developer tools

2967
01:48:41,925 --> 01:48:44,445
whereby I can actually see all of the CSS

2968
01:48:44,445 --> 01:48:47,085
that applies to the element I have just selected,

2969
01:48:47,206 --> 01:48:48,036
namely this link,

2970
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:50,445
and I see here in nice pretty printed fashion that

2971
01:48:50,445 --> 01:48:53,766
I'm using this color FF 0000 text decoration none.

2972
01:48:53,965 --> 01:48:54,695
Why is this useful?

2973
01:48:54,726 --> 01:48:54,846
Well,

2974
01:48:54,965 --> 01:48:55,286
one,

2975
01:48:55,726 --> 01:48:58,636
if you want to learn from another website how it's doing its thing,

2976
01:48:58,846 --> 01:49:00,456
you can just look at the CSS,

2977
01:49:00,565 --> 01:49:02,005
but also if you want to be able to iterate

2978
01:49:02,005 --> 01:49:03,806
more quickly and just kind of tinker with things.

2979
01:49:04,162 --> 01:49:09,151
I can actually turn the color on and off by just hovering over the inspector here

2980
01:49:09,361 --> 01:49:12,441
and just turn it on and off by clicking and unclicking,

2981
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:13,801
and if I want to just play around with,

2982
01:49:13,921 --> 01:49:17,611
oh maybe maybe Harvard should be 00 FF 00 E,

2983
01:49:17,921 --> 01:49:19,242
I can make a green instead,

2984
01:49:19,321 --> 01:49:24,532
so you can temporarily change the browser's copy of your own HTML or CSS

2985
01:49:24,642 --> 01:49:26,131
just to tinker and iterate quickly,

2986
01:49:26,202 --> 01:49:27,981
just like I tinkered with Stanford's

2987
01:49:28,682 --> 01:49:30,662
own website or at least my own

2988
01:49:31,122 --> 01:49:32,492
copy thereof.

2989
01:49:33,479 --> 01:49:33,930
Lastly,

2990
01:49:34,009 --> 01:49:35,850
how about in terms of the selectors?

2991
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:37,620
These are using type selectors,

2992
01:49:37,689 --> 01:49:39,439
that is selecting the name of the tag.

2993
01:49:39,609 --> 01:49:41,520
If I want to actually

2994
01:49:42,169 --> 01:49:44,080
affect one tag specifically,

2995
01:49:44,290 --> 01:49:48,009
a very common convention is to give an HTML element a unique ID.

2996
01:49:48,049 --> 01:49:48,370
For instance,

2997
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:49,879
I'm going to call this Harvard,

2998
01:49:50,129 --> 01:49:50,799
and by

2999
01:49:51,209 --> 01:49:54,129
honor system I should not give any other element in this.

3000
01:49:54,245 --> 01:49:55,984
Page in ID of Harvard.

3001
01:49:56,194 --> 01:49:58,234
The motivation is that I can now uniquely

3002
01:49:58,234 --> 01:50:01,225
identify this tag by for instance changing this

3003
01:50:01,555 --> 01:50:02,595
to hash Harvard,

3004
01:50:02,634 --> 01:50:06,185
which is just the convention for specifying that it's not a class now.

3005
01:50:06,194 --> 01:50:07,944
It's instead an ID.

3006
01:50:08,115 --> 01:50:11,345
You do not put the hash though in the actual value down here

3007
01:50:11,714 --> 01:50:15,194
and what I can even do down here is something like um.

3008
01:50:15,919 --> 01:50:16,790
Uh,

3009
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:19,169
Hash harbor to scope that as well.

3010
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:20,319
If I now reload,

3011
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:23,540
we're back to the red version and the same functionality as before,

3012
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:27,810
and it's just a more precise way now to target your CSS properties

3013
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,689
to a very specific

3014
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:31,009
element

3015
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:31,740
instead.

3016
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:32,470
OK,

3017
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:34,680
that was a lot.

3018
01:50:34,859 --> 01:50:35,939
Any questions

3019
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:37,319
on any of this

3020
01:50:38,009 --> 01:50:38,799
thus far?

3021
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:41,259
Now

3022
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:43,310
that clear.

3023
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:43,959
All right,

3024
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:44,379
well,

3025
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,430
one last language for the day,

3026
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:46,759
and,

3027
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:49,040
and we do mean what we say like that is the

3028
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,279
extent to which you will learn formally HTML and CSS.

3029
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:55,240
Like everything else just follows those exact same patterns.

3030
01:50:55,319 --> 01:50:56,319
It's different classes,

3031
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:57,319
it's different attributes,

3032
01:50:57,399 --> 01:50:58,560
it's different tag names,

3033
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,279
all of which can be picked up through practice,

3034
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:01,649
through osmosis,

3035
01:51:01,759 --> 01:51:02,029
through

3036
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:03,120
references,

3037
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,879
but that's really it for the fundamentals.

3038
01:51:04,959 --> 01:51:07,080
And so our last focus today is on an.

3039
01:51:07,226 --> 01:51:09,536
Actual programming language that we'll just scratch the surface

3040
01:51:09,536 --> 01:51:12,735
of if only because it's so darn omnipresent nowadays.

3041
01:51:12,895 --> 01:51:16,666
Most every website you use is made from not only HTML and CSS,

3042
01:51:16,695 --> 01:51:18,016
but if it's in any way interactive,

3043
01:51:18,096 --> 01:51:19,045
odds are it's using

3044
01:51:19,295 --> 01:51:19,895
JavaScript,

3045
01:51:19,936 --> 01:51:23,235
a programming language that is very commonly used client side,

3046
01:51:23,456 --> 01:51:25,565
whereby humans write the code on the server,

3047
01:51:25,695 --> 01:51:26,416
but then your browser,

3048
01:51:26,456 --> 01:51:27,005
as before,

3049
01:51:27,056 --> 01:51:29,576
downloads it to the client and then it runs in your own Mac,

3050
01:51:29,616 --> 01:51:30,726
your PC or your phone.

3051
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:31,375
That said,

3052
01:51:31,536 --> 01:51:32,005
JavaScript.

3053
01:51:32,062 --> 01:51:34,722
Also very popular on the server nowadays.

3054
01:51:34,731 --> 01:51:36,841
It's not just a browser-based language.

3055
01:51:37,012 --> 01:51:38,082
In JavaScript.

3056
01:51:38,372 --> 01:51:41,762
What you have most powerfully though is the ability in memory

3057
01:51:42,012 --> 01:51:44,671
to mutate this tree in real time.

3058
01:51:44,731 --> 01:51:45,131
In other words,

3059
01:51:45,171 --> 01:51:47,722
think about even your Gmail inbox or your Outlook inbox.

3060
01:51:47,932 --> 01:51:50,762
Typically you see email after email after email after email.

3061
01:51:50,932 --> 01:51:56,682
Odds are per today what HTML tag is creating that UI of row after row after row.

3062
01:51:58,069 --> 01:51:58,779
Which tag?

3063
01:51:59,250 --> 01:51:59,259
Like

3064
01:52:00,879 --> 01:52:01,609
table tag,

3065
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:03,129
like the table tag,

3066
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:04,240
probably right table row,

3067
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:05,390
table row table row,

3068
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,149
but

3069
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:07,310
it wouldn't make,

3070
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:07,709
well,

3071
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:11,240
actually this is the way things used to work in my day back in the day when you visited,

3072
01:52:11,339 --> 01:52:12,560
not even Gmail before it existed,

3073
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,970
but your email inbox,

3074
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:16,770
you would download from the server a web page containing

3075
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:19,569
a table tag with table rows and table data elements,

3076
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,069
and that was your inbox.

3077
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:22,799
If you wanted to see if you got new mail,

3078
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,200
you'd just reload the whole page and it would download new contents

3079
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,720
from the server and show you the new HTML with just.

3080
01:52:28,799 --> 01:52:29,669
JavaScript though,

3081
01:52:30,029 --> 01:52:32,299
which has come onto the scene over the past 20 plus years,

3082
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:36,180
you have the ability to download the data once initially,

3083
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:39,669
then use code to just grab some more data every 30 seconds

3084
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:42,240
or some more data pretty much any time an email arrives.

3085
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:45,919
And if this picture here represents not our super simple hello title,

3086
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,979
hello body page,

3087
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,819
but a whole bunch of table rows for your existing email,

3088
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:51,370
the moment you get more email,

3089
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:54,509
you can use JavaScript code to add another node to this tree,

3090
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:57,540
another node to this tree representing the table row tag.

3091
01:52:57,629 --> 01:52:58,229
The table row.

3092
01:52:58,459 --> 01:52:59,540
Tag again and again.

3093
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:00,250
So in short,

3094
01:53:00,459 --> 01:53:04,259
with JavaScript you have the ability to change the tree,

3095
01:53:04,339 --> 01:53:06,049
otherwise known as the Document

3096
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:07,520
object model,

3097
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:09,049
or DOM for short,

3098
01:53:09,299 --> 01:53:12,569
dynamically in order to evolve the web page.

3099
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:14,060
So let's take a quick tour of what

3100
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:16,810
JavaScript does have syntactically and then I'll just demonstrate

3101
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:20,689
some of the capabilities thereof without dwelling today on syntax beyond this.

3102
01:53:20,859 --> 01:53:21,740
So in Scratch,

3103
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:23,169
which is looking pretty good now,

3104
01:53:23,259 --> 01:53:25,009
you had conditionals which look like this.

3105
01:53:25,339 --> 01:53:27,220
In JavaScript it's pretty much the same as C,

3106
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:27,819
the curly brace.

3107
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:30,649
are back at least for two or more lines,

3108
01:53:30,919 --> 01:53:34,450
but indentation doesn't matter except for the style thereof

3109
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:37,009
as in contrast with Python.

3110
01:53:37,049 --> 01:53:37,770
If you have an ifL,

3111
01:53:38,049 --> 01:53:39,959
it's going to look the exact same in C.

3112
01:53:40,209 --> 01:53:41,089
If you have if if L,

3113
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,640
you have the exact same thing in C,

3114
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:46,250
different from Python because this was L if in Python.

3115
01:53:46,299 --> 01:53:49,959
Now we're back more verbosely to Ls if as in C.

3116
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,839
Variables in JavaScript.

3117
01:53:51,850 --> 01:53:51,930
Well,

3118
01:53:52,009 --> 01:53:54,379
here in Scratch is how you set a variable counter to zero.

3119
01:53:54,689 --> 01:53:55,319
In JavaScript,

3120
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:56,290
there's a few ways to do this,

3121
01:53:56,350 --> 01:53:56,720
but

3122
01:53:57,049 --> 01:53:59,870
the most A reasonable for now is to let

3123
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,479
counter equal 0,

3124
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:02,839
so you don't specify the type.

3125
01:54:02,959 --> 01:54:04,850
This is more of a polite way of asking the browser.

3126
01:54:04,879 --> 01:54:07,229
Please let a variable called counter exist

3127
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:09,790
and set it equal to 0 by default.

3128
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:10,919
Semicolons are back,

3129
01:54:10,959 --> 01:54:11,220
however,

3130
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:12,689
that's not strictly true.

3131
01:54:12,799 --> 01:54:15,750
Browsers are smart enough to know where semicolons actually matter,

3132
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,109
but for our purposes assume that they're always there.

3133
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:19,520
How do you change counter by 1?

3134
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:19,680
Well,

3135
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:20,910
you can do it the pedantic way,

3136
01:54:20,959 --> 01:54:21,990
which is a little verbose.

3137
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:26,850
You can do the plus equals trick or nicely back in play is the plus plus in JavaScript.

3138
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,859
Just like in C,

3139
01:54:28,109 --> 01:54:29,259
but not in Python.

3140
01:54:29,509 --> 01:54:31,209
Loops in JavaScript.

3141
01:54:31,229 --> 01:54:31,660
Well,

3142
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:32,390
in Scratch,

3143
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:33,910
if you want to do these 3 times,

3144
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:36,020
here's how you would do it in JavaScript.

3145
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:37,990
It's pretty much the same as C,

3146
01:54:38,009 --> 01:54:40,549
except for not mentioning the data type.

3147
01:54:40,629 --> 01:54:42,419
Instead you use the keyword let here,

3148
01:54:42,629 --> 01:54:45,100
but otherwise this is exactly the same as in C.

3149
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:46,669
If you want to do something forever,

3150
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,189
for whatever reason in JavaScript,

3151
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:49,390
you can say while true,

3152
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:51,339
which is exactly how we did it in C.

3153
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:55,189
If you have a web page like this,

3154
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:56,419
meanwhile,

3155
01:54:56,839 --> 01:54:58,979
And you want to insert some JavaScript to it,

3156
01:54:59,069 --> 01:54:59,950
you can do it in a couple,

3157
01:55:00,029 --> 01:55:01,100
a few different ways.

3158
01:55:01,229 --> 01:55:05,339
You can put a script tag just like the Style tag in the head of the web page.

3159
01:55:05,549 --> 01:55:07,669
This can get you into trouble though for reasons you

3160
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:10,660
might encounter whereby if you put your JavaScript code up here

3161
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:12,939
and you try to use it to modify the web page,

3162
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,540
but the web page isn't defined until down here,

3163
01:55:15,779 --> 01:55:21,459
you can get into some a race condition really where the data does not yet exist.

3164
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:25,100
So instead of putting it there or even in another file,

3165
01:55:25,189 --> 01:55:25,910
it's actually.

3166
01:55:26,184 --> 01:55:29,463
Common to to avoid that altogether by putting your script code or your script

3167
01:55:29,463 --> 01:55:32,854
tag at the end of the page just before the end of the body

3168
01:55:33,063 --> 01:55:36,003
to ensure that all of the webpage exists already.

3169
01:55:36,184 --> 01:55:38,824
This is similar in spirit to the deaf issues we saw

3170
01:55:38,824 --> 01:55:41,213
in Python or the prototype issues we saw in C.

3171
01:55:41,543 --> 01:55:44,253
There's bunches of solutions though to this here problem.

3172
01:55:44,503 --> 01:55:47,813
But let's now take some JavaScript for an actual spin

3173
01:55:48,104 --> 01:55:51,074
and use VS code to write some of it as follows.

3174
01:55:51,304 --> 01:55:52,023
In VS code,

3175
01:55:52,184 --> 01:55:53,744
let me go ahead and close link.

3176
01:55:53,903 --> 01:55:54,554
HTML.

3177
01:55:55,228 --> 01:55:58,578
Open up my terminal temporarily and let's improve my,

3178
01:55:58,698 --> 01:55:59,167
actually,

3179
01:55:59,377 --> 01:56:01,458
let's just improve the very file hello.

3180
01:56:01,638 --> 01:56:04,667
HTML that I have here in front of me and actually have it

3181
01:56:04,667 --> 01:56:07,607
be more interactive and give me sort of a pop up on the screen

3182
01:56:07,987 --> 01:56:08,728
when I

3183
01:56:08,978 --> 01:56:09,928
type in my name.

3184
01:56:10,217 --> 01:56:11,348
So let's start as follows.

3185
01:56:11,417 --> 01:56:11,817
First,

3186
01:56:11,937 --> 01:56:14,768
let's go ahead and change this just to uh hello,

3187
01:56:14,937 --> 01:56:15,728
just for short.

3188
01:56:15,897 --> 01:56:17,047
And in the body of this page,

3189
01:56:17,138 --> 01:56:18,448
let's give myself a form,

3190
01:56:18,618 --> 01:56:19,217
and in this form,

3191
01:56:19,257 --> 01:56:20,667
let's give myself an input.

3192
01:56:21,087 --> 01:56:21,098
Uh,

3193
01:56:21,138 --> 01:56:23,908
we'll turn off autocomplete just to avoid distractions.

3194
01:56:24,018 --> 01:56:24,337
We'll turn.

3195
01:56:24,421 --> 01:56:26,282
On autofocus to save me a click,

3196
01:56:26,421 --> 01:56:31,041
I'm going to give this HTML element an ID uniquely of name,

3197
01:56:31,332 --> 01:56:34,562
a placeholder also of name just so the human knows what to do,

3198
01:56:34,771 --> 01:56:36,372
and the type of this field shall be text.

3199
01:56:36,412 --> 01:56:36,892
In other words,

3200
01:56:36,932 --> 01:56:41,521
I want to create a program a week one and week 0 where I type in my name

3201
01:56:41,771 --> 01:56:43,521
and say hello such and such.

3202
01:56:43,691 --> 01:56:44,852
I'm going to give myself an input,

3203
01:56:45,452 --> 01:56:47,892
a submit button with input type equals submit.

3204
01:56:48,012 --> 01:56:49,441
Don't really care what the button says,

3205
01:56:49,651 --> 01:56:52,541
but I do care now when I go back to my other tab,

3206
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:53,492
close my.

3207
01:56:53,616 --> 01:56:54,556
Developer tools,

3208
01:56:54,806 --> 01:56:55,645
go back into hello.

3209
01:56:55,846 --> 01:56:56,275
HTML.

3210
01:56:56,386 --> 01:56:57,735
I now have something that looks like this.

3211
01:56:57,766 --> 01:57:00,166
It looks similar to our search example for cats,

3212
01:57:00,266 --> 01:57:03,536
but now I'm asking the user for their name along with the submit button.

3213
01:57:03,565 --> 01:57:06,476
But what I want to have happen is when I type in David and click submit,

3214
01:57:06,565 --> 01:57:08,956
I want to see Hello David somewhere on the screen.

3215
01:57:09,166 --> 01:57:09,246
Well,

3216
01:57:09,286 --> 01:57:10,246
how can I do this?

3217
01:57:10,326 --> 01:57:10,405
Well,

3218
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:11,286
a few different ways,

3219
01:57:11,366 --> 01:57:14,116
but JavaScript allows me to do things like this,

3220
01:57:14,405 --> 01:57:15,965
and for upcoming problem sets,

3221
01:57:16,005 --> 01:57:18,096
you won't necessarily have to write JavaScript like this.

3222
01:57:18,125 --> 01:57:19,875
So consider this a whirlwind tour,

3223
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:21,036
not so much

3224
01:57:21,675 --> 01:57:22,686
something to ingrain.

3225
01:57:23,049 --> 01:57:23,069
Here

3226
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:27,959
I can add a new attribute to the form tag called on submit,

3227
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:28,229
which,

3228
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:29,120
as the name suggests,

3229
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:33,189
means call the following function when this form is submitted.

3230
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:33,520
Well,

3231
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:34,919
what function do I want to call?

3232
01:57:34,979 --> 01:57:36,910
I'm going to call it a greet function,

3233
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,109
and that's it for now.

3234
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:40,229
How do I define a greet function?

3235
01:57:40,279 --> 01:57:40,520
Well,

3236
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,069
I could,

3237
01:57:41,229 --> 01:57:42,089
among other places,

3238
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:43,479
put this inside of the head of.

3239
01:57:43,785 --> 01:57:44,975
Page in a script tag.

3240
01:57:45,265 --> 01:57:48,424
I can define a function in JavaScript by literally saying function and then

3241
01:57:48,424 --> 01:57:51,254
the name of the function and then in parentheses any arguments there too.

3242
01:57:51,305 --> 01:57:52,334
I'm not going to have any.

3243
01:57:52,584 --> 01:57:54,904
And then in Curly braces I can actually define the meat

3244
01:57:54,904 --> 01:57:57,375
of that function and for instance I can do this.

3245
01:57:57,854 --> 01:58:00,415
Let name equal the following

3246
01:58:00,745 --> 01:58:01,575
document.

3247
01:58:01,714 --> 01:58:03,935
query selector.

3248
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:08,750
And now what I want to do is this Document is a global variable that just

3249
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:11,109
comes with JavaScript in the browser that allows

3250
01:58:11,109 --> 01:58:13,129
me to write code involving the whole document,

3251
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:14,339
the webpage itself.

3252
01:58:14,669 --> 01:58:16,750
Query selector is a fancy name for a function.

3253
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,959
That lets me select specific

3254
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:20,919
elements of the page

3255
01:58:21,209 --> 01:58:22,879
using CSS selector.

3256
01:58:22,979 --> 01:58:25,729
So the very same syntax we saw with names and with dots and

3257
01:58:25,729 --> 01:58:29,720
with hash symbols a moment ago are back in play for JavaScript here.

3258
01:58:29,899 --> 01:58:35,759
So if I want to create a variable that stores the name that the human typed in,

3259
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:38,439
what I can do is pass to query selector

3260
01:58:38,649 --> 01:58:39,669
a selector

3261
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:43,089
for that element which is quote unquote hash name or hash.

3262
01:58:43,214 --> 01:58:44,194
Just means ID,

3263
01:58:44,524 --> 01:58:48,395
but the reason I'm using name is because the unique identifier I put here is name.

3264
01:58:48,524 --> 01:58:50,484
If I change this to Foo nonsensically,

3265
01:58:50,524 --> 01:58:51,154
that's fine.

3266
01:58:51,285 --> 01:58:53,205
I just have to change this to Foo up here,

3267
01:58:53,254 --> 01:58:55,915
so I'm in full control over what is called what.

3268
01:58:56,055 --> 01:58:58,674
But if I want to get the value that the user typed into that box,

3269
01:58:58,845 --> 01:58:59,734
I now do value,

3270
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,075
and we've seen these dots before.

3271
01:59:01,125 --> 01:59:02,975
In C they were for accessing strucks.

3272
01:59:03,084 --> 01:59:05,904
In Python they were for accessing contents of objects.

3273
01:59:06,084 --> 01:59:07,225
So this just means

3274
01:59:07,604 --> 01:59:09,165
use the document global variable.

3275
01:59:09,759 --> 01:59:12,910
Use the query selector function or method inside of it.

3276
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:15,270
Get the element whose unique ID is name,

3277
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:18,109
and then go inside of that text box and give me its value.

3278
01:59:18,279 --> 01:59:20,120
So it's a very long winded way of saying

3279
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,459
store the user's input in a variable called name.

3280
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:23,589
But what's nice now,

3281
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:24,770
even though this is going to be a bit ugly.

3282
01:59:25,379 --> 01:59:29,540
is I can then use a built in JavaScript function called alert,

3283
01:59:29,549 --> 01:59:31,129
and I can say something like hello,

3284
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:31,830
comma,

3285
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:32,970
close quote,

3286
01:59:33,259 --> 01:59:34,089
then plus,

3287
01:59:34,259 --> 01:59:37,729
which we've seen before in Python and concatenate with it

3288
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:40,129
that name's value.

3289
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:43,529
Now this isn't quite complete and for reasons I'm going to wave my hand at,

3290
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:46,060
I also need to add annoyingly returned false

3291
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:48,049
down here because otherwise if I click submit,

3292
01:59:48,259 --> 01:59:48,450
yes,

3293
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,689
the great function will get called,

3294
01:59:49,779 --> 01:59:52,339
but the browser will still try to submit the form to a server,

3295
01:59:52,379 --> 01:59:53,580
which is going to interrupt my own code.

3296
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:54,660
So long story short,

3297
01:59:54,819 --> 01:59:56,529
this is a bit of a hackish approach for now.

3298
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:59,169
So just making sure that the only thing that happens when

3299
01:59:59,169 --> 02:00:02,479
I submit this form is that my function is called.

3300
02:00:02,779 --> 02:00:04,209
Now if I didn't screw anything up,

3301
02:00:04,339 --> 02:00:06,609
I should now see after reloading this page.

3302
02:00:06,687 --> 02:00:08,027
A prompt for my name.

3303
02:00:08,277 --> 02:00:10,708
I'll type it in and when I click submit,

3304
02:00:10,877 --> 02:00:13,187
I should see an ugly but functional

3305
02:00:13,558 --> 02:00:16,797
alert box pop up with dynamically generated text,

3306
02:00:16,897 --> 02:00:18,877
namely hello David.

3307
02:00:19,078 --> 02:00:20,518
I say it's ugly because by convention,

3308
02:00:20,598 --> 02:00:24,437
Chrome shows you the full URL or the domain name of the website in question,

3309
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:25,797
which is my randomly generated one,

3310
02:00:25,837 --> 02:00:26,987
which does look stupid.

3311
02:00:27,158 --> 02:00:28,288
So we can do better than this.

3312
02:00:28,397 --> 02:00:28,808
But

3313
02:00:29,198 --> 02:00:30,388
the point is now

3314
02:00:30,587 --> 02:00:32,638
that I have written code in Java.

3315
02:00:32,976 --> 02:00:33,485
Script

3316
02:00:33,815 --> 02:00:35,965
to listen for the submission of this form

3317
02:00:35,965 --> 02:00:38,686
and when that happens call that their function.

3318
02:00:38,855 --> 02:00:41,405
And this is generally the paradigm of JavaScript.

3319
02:00:41,576 --> 02:00:44,735
There exists in the context of websites a whole bunch of events that can

3320
02:00:44,735 --> 02:00:47,525
happen and this is a word we haven't used since week zero in Scratch.

3321
02:00:47,695 --> 02:00:49,675
Recall that in Scratch you have events like when green

3322
02:00:49,675 --> 02:00:51,485
flag clicked and when the green flag is clicked,

3323
02:00:51,576 --> 02:00:53,145
you can do something in response.

3324
02:00:53,476 --> 02:00:55,405
Same thing in the world of web programming.

3325
02:00:55,616 --> 02:00:58,826
Here are just some of the events that can happen in a web page like.

3326
02:00:58,883 --> 02:01:00,204
The user can change something,

3327
02:01:00,284 --> 02:01:00,954
click on something,

3328
02:01:01,074 --> 02:01:01,854
drag something,

3329
02:01:02,034 --> 02:01:02,394
key up,

3330
02:01:02,594 --> 02:01:03,273
put the keyboard up,

3331
02:01:03,354 --> 02:01:04,344
put the mouse down,

3332
02:01:04,594 --> 02:01:05,624
or other things.

3333
02:01:05,954 --> 02:01:08,264
What I'm listening for is the submission of a form,

3334
02:01:08,474 --> 02:01:10,664
which is cool because in JavaScript then

3335
02:01:10,664 --> 02:01:13,074
you can essentially write code that listens

3336
02:01:13,074 --> 02:01:16,394
for any number of these events and then does something when it happens.

3337
02:01:16,554 --> 02:01:17,554
Consider after all in Gmail,

3338
02:01:17,594 --> 02:01:21,144
if you click the little refresh icon within Gmail itself to get new mail,

3339
02:01:21,333 --> 02:01:23,023
it runs some JavaScript code,

3340
02:01:23,034 --> 02:01:24,874
it turns out to talk to Google's server.

3341
02:01:25,291 --> 02:01:27,171
Get more email and update your site.

3342
02:01:27,332 --> 02:01:31,312
If you click and drag on Google Maps to see like higher up geographically,

3343
02:01:31,492 --> 02:01:31,611
well,

3344
02:01:31,651 --> 02:01:32,211
what's happening?

3345
02:01:32,291 --> 02:01:35,521
Some JavaScript code is listening for your mouse going down

3346
02:01:35,731 --> 02:01:38,651
and dragging so as to go fetch more tiles,

3347
02:01:38,771 --> 02:01:42,051
more rectangular pictures of the map wherever you're trying to drag.

3348
02:01:42,102 --> 02:01:43,952
So anything that's interactive in websites

3349
02:01:43,952 --> 02:01:46,492
nowadays like that is using JavaScript by

3350
02:01:46,492 --> 02:01:50,932
just listening for things that you or someone else might actually do.

3351
02:01:51,399 --> 02:01:51,529
Well,

3352
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:54,640
let me go ahead and start opening some pre-made examples just to give you

3353
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:58,399
a sense of the other syntax that is in use today with JavaScript.

3354
02:01:58,509 --> 02:02:03,870
I'm going to go ahead and open up a version of this Hello program called Helloo2.

3355
02:02:04,299 --> 02:02:05,109
HTML,

3356
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:07,600
which is different in that I'm practicing what

3357
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:10,120
I preached earlier by putting the script tag at

3358
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,520
the bottom of the page just to ensure that

3359
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,509
the form and everything inside of it already.

3360
02:02:14,609 --> 02:02:17,919
Exists for sure by the time this code executes.

3361
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:18,520
Moreover,

3362
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:23,109
what I'm getting out of is the business of using the on-submit attribute.

3363
02:02:23,319 --> 02:02:28,029
So just as I tried to get my CSS out of my HTML and put it elsewhere,

3364
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:28,600
similarly,

3365
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:31,040
I'm trying to get my JavaScript code like the greet

3366
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,709
function out of the HTML and putting it down here.

3367
02:02:33,879 --> 02:02:34,720
Now why is this useful?

3368
02:02:34,759 --> 02:02:35,689
This is a big mouthful,

3369
02:02:35,759 --> 02:02:37,839
but it just follows a general pattern as follows.

3370
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:38,810
Document.

3371
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:42,490
query selector quote unquote form is just getting a

3372
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:45,049
reference to the actual form element in the page.

3373
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:46,819
So if you imagine in your mind's eye that this

3374
02:02:46,819 --> 02:02:49,000
is drawn out as a tree in the computer's memory,

3375
02:02:49,209 --> 02:02:51,459
this is just getting me a point or two,

3376
02:02:51,529 --> 02:02:53,529
the form node in that tree.

3377
02:02:53,959 --> 02:02:54,839
Haven't seen this before,

3378
02:02:54,919 --> 02:02:56,310
but it kind of does what it says.

3379
02:02:56,600 --> 02:03:00,589
Add event listener is a function or method that you can call on any element

3380
02:03:00,879 --> 02:03:03,750
that just tells it to listen subsequently for this event,

3381
02:03:03,759 --> 02:03:05,029
and when that event is heard,

3382
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,290
submit in this case,

3383
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,560
call the following anonymous function,

3384
02:03:08,569 --> 02:03:09,919
otherwise known as a lambda function.

3385
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:10,799
But long story short,

3386
02:03:10,839 --> 02:03:14,390
this syntax just means when submit happens on that element,

3387
02:03:14,649 --> 02:03:17,479
execute the code between these curly braces.

3388
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,279
What happens?

3389
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:18,899
alert,

3390
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:19,560
hello,

3391
02:03:19,589 --> 02:03:20,459
quote unquote document.

3392
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:21,399
query select or name.

3393
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:21,720
value.

3394
02:03:21,759 --> 02:03:23,200
I didn't bother with the variable this time.

3395
02:03:23,549 --> 02:03:26,000
This does exactly the same thing but is a

3396
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,790
purely JavaScript solution without using the unsubmit attribute,

3397
02:03:29,839 --> 02:03:31,529
and we show you this only because,

3398
02:03:31,779 --> 02:03:33,100
especially for final projects,

3399
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:35,459
you might want to do something like add event

3400
02:03:35,459 --> 02:03:37,689
listener to make like maybe a drop down menu

3401
02:03:37,689 --> 02:03:40,500
or some interactive clickable thing in your website that

3402
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:42,689
just listens for one of these events to happen

3403
02:03:43,089 --> 02:03:44,850
before actually executing some code.

3404
02:03:45,379 --> 02:03:47,225
Notice I've been Conventionally using single

3405
02:03:47,225 --> 02:03:48,665
quotes in JavaScript because that's just a

3406
02:03:48,665 --> 02:03:50,544
thing in the JavaScript community to generally

3407
02:03:50,544 --> 02:03:52,024
prefer single quotes over double quotes.

3408
02:03:52,104 --> 02:03:52,575
Why?

3409
02:03:52,865 --> 02:03:53,024
Well,

3410
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:56,095
it means people in JavaScript are hitting the shift symbol like much

3411
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:58,104
less than the rest of the world to get double quotes.

3412
02:03:58,265 --> 02:04:00,424
It's just a convention so long as you're consistent,

3413
02:04:00,944 --> 02:04:02,214
either is fine,

3414
02:04:02,785 --> 02:04:05,814
conditional on not having actual apostrophes and text and such.

3415
02:04:06,274 --> 02:04:07,455
Let me show you one other

3416
02:04:07,825 --> 02:04:08,464
convention.

3417
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:13,790
Instead of putting my code at the bottom of my page just before the body ends,

3418
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:16,740
it is also alternatively conventional,

3419
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:18,109
as in hello 3.

3420
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:19,580
HTML to do this,

3421
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:22,680
to still maybe put the script tag at the top of the page,

3422
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:23,430
but

3423
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:28,149
to additionally have this magical line whereby you add an event listener

3424
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:31,229
before you do anything else that listens for this crazy weirdly.

3425
02:04:31,379 --> 02:04:34,060
Named event called Dom Content loaded.

3426
02:04:34,290 --> 02:04:35,569
But now that you've heard DOM briefly,

3427
02:04:35,689 --> 02:04:36,879
DOM is document object model.

3428
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:38,169
It just means the tree in memory.

3429
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:42,279
This is just the fancy way of saying when that tree is loaded,

3430
02:04:42,649 --> 02:04:44,200
go ahead and do the following,

3431
02:04:44,209 --> 02:04:47,370
and this ensures that when a browser reads all of this code top to bottom,

3432
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:48,060
left to right,

3433
02:04:48,290 --> 02:04:50,569
this code won't actually be executed until the

3434
02:04:50,569 --> 02:04:53,040
whole DOM is loaded into the computer's memory.

3435
02:04:53,049 --> 02:04:53,839
That whole tree.

3436
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:56,979
Is built so that's all that's being referred to there.

3437
02:04:57,109 --> 02:05:00,620
The rest of the code is actually exactly the same.

3438
02:05:01,229 --> 02:05:01,240
Um,

3439
02:05:01,310 --> 02:05:02,109
what more can we do?

3440
02:05:02,189 --> 02:05:02,339
Well,

3441
02:05:02,549 --> 02:05:03,430
just so you've seen it,

3442
02:05:03,490 --> 02:05:04,870
I can delete all of that code,

3443
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:07,580
move it to a file called like hello.js,

3444
02:05:07,709 --> 02:05:09,500
and in the fourth version of this example,

3445
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:13,950
I'm back to just HTML because I can put all of the fancy complexity

3446
02:05:14,470 --> 02:05:17,700
inside of my script tag here,

3447
02:05:17,950 --> 02:05:20,879
factoring that code out into hello4.js,

3448
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:22,629
but the code is otherwise I claim.

3449
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,189
Unchanged

3450
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:25,759
All right,

3451
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:26,319
there's a lot.

3452
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:27,669
I know it's quick,

3453
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:30,020
but do the general principles make sense,

3454
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:33,430
like just listening for events and running some code in response.

3455
02:05:33,509 --> 02:05:35,870
That's really all we're talking about a week zero.

3456
02:05:36,669 --> 02:05:37,660
With scratch

3457
02:05:38,859 --> 02:05:39,060
All right,

3458
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:39,290
well,

3459
02:05:39,379 --> 02:05:39,459
let,

3460
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,529
let me let things escalate just a little bit,

3461
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:43,729
and this time I'll open the demo first.

3462
02:05:43,979 --> 02:05:46,899
Let me go ahead and open up hello 5.

3463
02:05:47,020 --> 02:05:47,569
HTML,

3464
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:48,740
which I wrote in advance,

3465
02:05:48,939 --> 02:05:49,220
which,

3466
02:05:49,259 --> 02:05:49,450
OK,

3467
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:51,310
is definitely starting to look like a mouthful,

3468
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:53,609
but in a moment it'll make a bit more sense.

3469
02:05:53,779 --> 02:05:56,089
Let me go ahead into my other tab here,

3470
02:05:56,339 --> 02:05:57,129
click back,

3471
02:05:57,339 --> 02:05:58,169
go into Source 8,

3472
02:05:58,180 --> 02:05:59,899
which is all of my pre-made examples,

3473
02:05:59,919 --> 02:06:02,330
and I said that we're in Hello 5 now.

3474
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:05,660
And in Hello 5 there's no submit button because watch

3475
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:08,100
this fanciness when I search for something like C.

3476
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:09,180
Uh,

3477
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:09,859
or

3478
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:10,859
David

3479
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:12,299
as a full fledged word there.

3480
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:13,620
Notice it's just happening

3481
02:06:14,029 --> 02:06:14,759
inside of the web page.

3482
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:15,189
Moreover,

3483
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:15,870
if you poke around,

3484
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:17,919
let me right click on the page.

3485
02:06:18,029 --> 02:06:20,069
Let me inspect to open my developer tools.

3486
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:23,350
Let me expand the body down here and actually let me reload the page.

3487
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,270
So notice by default this is what my web page looks like.

3488
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:28,859
It's just got an empty paragraph tag for some reason,

3489
02:06:29,069 --> 02:06:31,220
but watch what happens at the bottom of the screen,

3490
02:06:31,310 --> 02:06:32,779
and I'll zoom in a bit more

3491
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:35,709
when I start typing my name like D.

3492
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:38,629
And then let me expand this triangle.

3493
02:06:38,919 --> 02:06:39,709
You see at the beginning,

3494
02:06:39,870 --> 02:06:40,430
A,

3495
02:06:40,759 --> 02:06:41,209
V,

3496
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,089
I,

3497
02:06:42,729 --> 02:06:45,229
when I say that JavaScript can mutate the DOM,

3498
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,319
the actual tree in memory,

3499
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:47,560
like that's what you're seeing.

3500
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,160
You're seeing the HTML pretty parented color coded version of

3501
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,790
that tree in memory and how is it working?

3502
02:06:52,879 --> 02:06:52,959
Well,

3503
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,350
if we go back to the code here,

3504
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:54,660
well,

3505
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,000
let me wave my hands at this first line.

3506
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:58,439
This just means don't do this until the whole DOM is loaded.

3507
02:06:58,720 --> 02:06:59,910
Let's look at this line,

3508
02:06:59,959 --> 02:07:01,879
which means give me a variable called input

3509
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:03,450
and set that equal to.

3510
02:07:03,504 --> 02:07:04,044
OK,

3511
02:07:04,214 --> 02:07:05,694
the input tag on the page,

3512
02:07:05,734 --> 02:07:06,685
the text box,

3513
02:07:06,895 --> 02:07:07,694
and then do what?

3514
02:07:07,814 --> 02:07:08,964
We'll take that input,

3515
02:07:09,214 --> 02:07:11,694
add an event listener that's forever listening for key up,

3516
02:07:11,854 --> 02:07:13,924
like my finger going up off the keyboard,

3517
02:07:14,055 --> 02:07:14,774
and when that happens,

3518
02:07:14,895 --> 02:07:16,015
call the following function,

3519
02:07:16,055 --> 02:07:16,805
which has no name,

3520
02:07:16,895 --> 02:07:20,495
but that just means call these lines inside of the curly braces.

3521
02:07:20,535 --> 02:07:20,654
Well,

3522
02:07:20,694 --> 02:07:22,854
what happens inside of those curly braces?

3523
02:07:22,895 --> 02:07:22,984
Well,

3524
02:07:23,055 --> 02:07:24,435
here's a variable called name,

3525
02:07:24,654 --> 02:07:28,055
and this is just pointing at the paragraph tag apparently.

3526
02:07:28,509 --> 02:07:29,740
I'm checking this question,

3527
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:31,359
if there's hm if input.

3528
02:07:31,629 --> 02:07:32,060
value,

3529
02:07:32,189 --> 02:07:36,140
so this is like saying if input value does not equal quote unquote,

3530
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:37,399
just implicitly,

3531
02:07:37,709 --> 02:07:41,330
go ahead and set the inner HTML of that name.

3532
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:44,939
Variable equal to hello

3533
02:07:46,759 --> 02:07:47,120
input.

3534
02:07:47,390 --> 02:07:47,779
value.

3535
02:07:48,029 --> 02:07:49,629
Now this is crazy syntax and I'm showing it

3536
02:07:49,629 --> 02:07:51,700
just because you'll see it on documentation online.

3537
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:54,779
This is similar in spirit to Python's F strings.

3538
02:07:54,790 --> 02:07:59,580
It's ugly syntax with dollar signs and curly braces and worse yet back ticks.

3539
02:07:59,729 --> 02:08:00,060
However,

3540
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:02,910
this is a manifestation of really the JavaScript community presumably

3541
02:08:02,910 --> 02:08:05,149
deciding that if you want the language to evolve.

3542
02:08:05,255 --> 02:08:06,895
So you have to make sure you're backwards

3543
02:08:06,895 --> 02:08:09,056
compatible with old versions of the language.

3544
02:08:09,226 --> 02:08:14,255
So they chose characters and syntax that probably do not appear already in the wild.

3545
02:08:14,465 --> 02:08:16,186
That's why sometimes things look uglier,

3546
02:08:16,266 --> 02:08:17,815
I would surmise than otherwise.

3547
02:08:17,985 --> 02:08:18,826
But long story short,

3548
02:08:18,905 --> 02:08:20,855
this just means if there's input there,

3549
02:08:21,025 --> 02:08:21,996
go ahead and say hello,

3550
02:08:22,266 --> 02:08:22,775
input.

3551
02:08:22,866 --> 02:08:26,056
Otherwise it says by default hello whoever you are.

3552
02:08:26,065 --> 02:08:26,465
And in fact,

3553
02:08:26,505 --> 02:08:28,056
if I go back here and delete my name,

3554
02:08:28,145 --> 02:08:28,306
watch.

3555
02:08:28,392 --> 02:08:29,301
What happens,

3556
02:08:29,341 --> 02:08:30,892
it goes back to that default.

3557
02:08:31,062 --> 02:08:34,412
So here's just an example of listening for keystrokes going up

3558
02:08:34,412 --> 02:08:38,091
and down and making sure that the page responds accordingly.

3559
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:39,291
How about something else?

3560
02:08:39,341 --> 02:08:42,211
Let me go back into my directory listing.

3561
02:08:42,461 --> 02:08:43,742
Let me open up Background.

3562
02:08:43,901 --> 02:08:44,341
HTML,

3563
02:08:44,381 --> 02:08:45,301
which I wrote in advance.

3564
02:08:45,341 --> 02:08:46,012
It's super simple,

3565
02:08:46,071 --> 02:08:49,872
but this is the first of like an interactive website that has 3 buttons labeled R,

3566
02:08:49,941 --> 02:08:50,142
G,

3567
02:08:50,151 --> 02:08:50,541
and B,

3568
02:08:50,582 --> 02:08:51,532
as you might imagine,

3569
02:08:51,801 --> 02:08:53,131
clicking on R does that.

3570
02:08:53,262 --> 02:08:54,051
G does this.

3571
02:08:54,102 --> 02:08:54,901
B does that.

3572
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,580
Well,

3573
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:56,459
how is this working?

3574
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:58,020
This is the first example now where you

3575
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:01,569
can use JavaScript code to alter CSS dynamically.

3576
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,540
So let me reload the page so it's back to white.

3577
02:09:03,859 --> 02:09:05,689
Let me open developer tools

3578
02:09:05,979 --> 02:09:09,500
and watch what's happening now on the body tag specifically.

3579
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:12,779
Initially there's no stylization on the body other than

3580
02:09:12,779 --> 02:09:15,410
the browser's default margins and whatnot over here,

3581
02:09:15,549 --> 02:09:19,220
but watch what happens at bottom right when I click on the R button.

3582
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:24,009
You see that all of a sudden background color coal in red was dynamically added.

3583
02:09:24,089 --> 02:09:24,919
Now it's green,

3584
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:25,890
now it's blue,

3585
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:28,649
and notice the HTML at bottom left is changing too.

3586
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:29,680
So somehow

3587
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:33,359
I am listening for clicks and then changing CSS in response.

3588
02:09:33,529 --> 02:09:34,669
So if I go back to VS code,

3589
02:09:34,729 --> 02:09:35,490
let's close hello.

3590
02:09:36,330 --> 02:09:39,319
Let's open up Source 8's version of Background.

3591
02:09:39,479 --> 02:09:42,169
HTML and in here it's a bit of a mouthful,

3592
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:43,560
but the HTML is simple.

3593
02:09:43,799 --> 02:09:44,819
Here's 3 buttons,

3594
02:09:44,919 --> 02:09:47,879
and because I wanted them to be uniquely identifiable,

3595
02:09:47,959 --> 02:09:49,439
I gave them all IDs of red,

3596
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:49,799
green,

3597
02:09:49,879 --> 02:09:50,470
and blue,

3598
02:09:50,839 --> 02:09:51,399
respectively.

3599
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,589
And then this code is a bit of copy paste,

3600
02:09:53,629 --> 02:09:56,069
and frankly I could probably avoid that if I were more elegant,

3601
02:09:56,109 --> 02:09:57,299
but just to be pedantic,

3602
02:09:57,589 --> 02:09:58,589
here's what's happening.

3603
02:09:58,870 --> 02:10:00,459
Here's a variable called body

3604
02:10:00,629 --> 02:10:02,330
that's just getting the body

3605
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:03,020
element,

3606
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:05,589
the node in the tree at that moment in time.

3607
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:07,569
And then these three lines of code,

3608
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:09,580
their purpose in life is to handle the red clicks.

3609
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:10,049
How?

3610
02:10:10,299 --> 02:10:10,459
Well,

3611
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:11,729
we're telling the document

3612
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:14,970
to select the element whose ID is red,

3613
02:10:15,379 --> 02:10:17,089
listen for the click event,

3614
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:18,609
and whenever that happens,

3615
02:10:18,859 --> 02:10:20,009
do this

3616
02:10:20,459 --> 02:10:20,810
body,

3617
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,529
which is the same variable as before,

3618
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:23,459
style,

3619
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:24,459
which we haven't seen before,

3620
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:28,899
but any element can have a style property associated with it in JavaScript.

3621
02:10:29,069 --> 02:10:31,660
Background color equals unquote red,

3622
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:34,600
and the other blocks of code are the exact same thing for green and for blue.

3623
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:34,899
The whole.

3624
02:10:35,205 --> 02:10:38,015
here is we're now listening for clicks on buttons

3625
02:10:38,015 --> 02:10:40,285
and changing not the contents of the button,

3626
02:10:40,415 --> 02:10:41,765
but rather the style

3627
02:10:42,134 --> 02:10:43,685
thereof of the whole page.

3628
02:10:43,975 --> 02:10:44,654
As an aside,

3629
02:10:44,794 --> 02:10:46,495
this is curio curiosity.

3630
02:10:46,575 --> 02:10:49,805
This is what's known as camel case whereby like a camel has a hump in the middle.

3631
02:10:50,015 --> 02:10:52,375
This word has a hump in the middle like capital

3632
02:10:52,375 --> 02:10:54,694
C all of a sudden to separate the two words.

3633
02:10:54,895 --> 02:10:58,615
In CSS recall it was a moment ago background

3634
02:10:59,214 --> 02:10:59,805
color.

3635
02:11:00,314 --> 02:11:04,095
Anyone want to guess why this is not how you write it in JavaScript?

3636
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:09,379
Anything with hyphens in CSS is changed to Camelcase in JavaScript.

3637
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:12,450
Uh,

3638
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,169
it's not related to comments.

3639
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:15,270
It's simpler

3640
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:15,759
than that,

3641
02:11:15,810 --> 02:11:16,399
yeah.

3642
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:18,930
Yeah,

3643
02:11:19,169 --> 02:11:19,250
right,

3644
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:21,009
and like left hand wasn't talking to right hand,

3645
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:21,680
and people were like,

3646
02:11:21,729 --> 02:11:22,370
oh damn it,

3647
02:11:22,490 --> 02:11:24,529
like this now means background minus color,

3648
02:11:24,609 --> 02:11:28,089
which is not a thing because minus is indeed just like in CNN Python,

3649
02:11:28,129 --> 02:11:29,279
a mathematical operator.

3650
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:32,120
So the world decides to reconcile this problem by

3651
02:11:32,330 --> 02:11:33,450
just capitalizing.

3652
02:11:33,729 --> 02:11:34,020
Uh,

3653
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:36,390
the character that would otherwise be where the hyphen is.

3654
02:11:36,399 --> 02:11:36,410
Well,

3655
02:11:36,799 --> 02:11:38,149
little CSS trivia.

3656
02:11:38,379 --> 02:11:38,520
All right,

3657
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:39,399
what else can we do?

3658
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:41,310
How about a couple of final

3659
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:42,810
examples here?

3660
02:11:42,919 --> 02:11:44,399
So what more can we do with CSS?

3661
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:46,080
So back in my day too,

3662
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:48,919
we had a tag called the HTML blink tag,

3663
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,240
which is among the few tags in the world of HTML.

3664
02:11:51,595 --> 02:11:54,234
That has actually been deprecated that is removed from language.

3665
02:11:54,314 --> 02:11:56,354
Like no one removes things from languages generally,

3666
02:11:56,435 --> 02:11:58,955
but the blink tag was so hideous followed only by the

3667
02:11:58,955 --> 02:12:01,944
marquee tag where by my own home page just like a freshman

3668
02:12:01,944 --> 02:12:05,234
had like welcome to my home page just moving across the

3669
02:12:05,234 --> 02:12:07,424
screen like this from left to right for no good reason,

3670
02:12:07,564 --> 02:12:08,915
like an ugly marquee and like.

3671
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:11,430
on like a digital signage nowadays,

3672
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:14,319
but we can bring it back as follows.

3673
02:12:14,439 --> 02:12:16,439
So if I close out my developer tools,

3674
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,169
go back into my source directory,

3675
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:19,000
and open up blank,

3676
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:22,109
this is what the blink tag used to do back in the day.

3677
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:23,509
Now this version

3678
02:12:23,879 --> 02:12:26,729
is implemented instead in JavaScript code as follows.

3679
02:12:26,839 --> 02:12:28,600
I have a function here called Blink,

3680
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:31,270
which I'm apparently calling every once in a while.

3681
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,080
How is that happening?

3682
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:33,319
Well,

3683
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:34,160
let's scroll down.

3684
02:12:34,689 --> 02:12:35,689
Here's my HTML.

3685
02:12:35,890 --> 02:12:36,410
Super simple,

3686
02:12:36,569 --> 02:12:37,689
literally just says hello world,

3687
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:38,240
but

3688
02:12:38,490 --> 02:12:41,330
notice this there's another global variable we haven't seen in

3689
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:44,169
JavaScript called Window that refers to like the general window,

3690
02:12:44,209 --> 02:12:46,120
not necessarily the contents of the page,

3691
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:50,129
where you can call a method called set interval and you can tell that method

3692
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:51,729
set interval to call a specific.

3693
02:12:51,839 --> 02:12:53,959
Function every number of milliseconds.

3694
02:12:54,029 --> 02:12:56,470
So if I want to call blank every 500 milliseconds,

3695
02:12:56,589 --> 02:12:58,080
that's the line of code that I use.

3696
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:59,799
If I scroll up to now this function,

3697
02:12:59,910 --> 02:13:03,899
let's see how blink is implemented both now and perhaps back in the day.

3698
02:13:04,109 --> 02:13:04,310
Well,

3699
02:13:04,549 --> 02:13:09,180
body is a variable here that's just pointing to the body node in the DOM,

3700
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:11,229
and this is a big mouthful,

3701
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:12,870
but if that body's

3702
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:17,750
styles visibility property in CSS is quote unquote hidden.

3703
02:13:18,229 --> 02:13:22,220
Then change that body style's visibility property to be visible.

3704
02:13:22,509 --> 02:13:24,069
Otherwise change it

3705
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:25,620
to be hidden instead.

3706
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:26,419
Here too,

3707
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:29,109
don't understand why left hand and right hand weren't talking to one another.

3708
02:13:29,229 --> 02:13:31,680
You would think that the opposite of visible would be

3709
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:32,500
invisible,

3710
02:13:32,549 --> 02:13:35,149
but in CSS the opposite of visible is hidden.

3711
02:13:35,450 --> 02:13:37,310
Just have to memorize stupid things like that,

3712
02:13:37,479 --> 02:13:38,560
but what's this really doing?

3713
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:41,100
It's just changing the CSS from hidden to visible,

3714
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:44,279
hidden to visible every 500 milliseconds.

3715
02:13:44,359 --> 02:13:49,240
So in fact what you're seeing here in the blink is if I inspect this page too

3716
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:51,629
and now notice it's kind of fun just to watch it,

3717
02:13:51,759 --> 02:13:54,439
you can see the HTML at bottom left and the CSS at

3718
02:13:54,439 --> 02:13:56,439
bottom right just automatically changing because

3719
02:13:56,439 --> 02:13:59,560
I'm doing that every 500 milliseconds.

3720
02:13:59,720 --> 02:13:59,959
All right,

3721
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,060
how about one other?

3722
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:01,240
Well,

3723
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:02,160
autocomplete.

3724
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:02,299
Well,

3725
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:02,600
we saw.

3726
02:14:02,683 --> 02:14:06,362
a step toward this with my he David example a moment ago.

3727
02:14:06,632 --> 02:14:08,792
Super common though in Google and like every website

3728
02:14:08,792 --> 02:14:11,022
now to automatically try to finish your thought.

3729
02:14:11,272 --> 02:14:12,192
How is that happening?

3730
02:14:12,312 --> 02:14:12,362
Well,

3731
02:14:12,433 --> 02:14:14,092
that's not just HTML and CSS.

3732
02:14:14,112 --> 02:14:15,143
That is also

3733
02:14:15,672 --> 02:14:17,583
some JavaScript thrown into the mix.

3734
02:14:17,833 --> 02:14:18,462
So for instance,

3735
02:14:18,553 --> 02:14:22,703
let me go into my terminal and open up Source 8's example called Autocomplete.

3736
02:14:23,112 --> 02:14:23,982
HTML,

3737
02:14:24,232 --> 02:14:28,312
and here I am going to borrow a file called Lage.js,

3738
02:14:28,433 --> 02:14:29,703
which is just a massive version.

3739
02:14:29,712 --> 02:14:31,295
I'll Open that too if you're curious.

3740
02:14:31,585 --> 02:14:35,766
Large.js is just a huge JavaScript array,

3741
02:14:35,866 --> 02:14:39,735
a razorback containing all of the words from Problemset 5,

3742
02:14:39,786 --> 02:14:40,985
the spell checking problem set,

3743
02:14:41,025 --> 02:14:43,136
where you had 100,000 plus words

3744
02:14:43,425 --> 02:14:44,215
in

3745
02:14:45,346 --> 02:14:46,695
in a file given to you.

3746
02:14:46,846 --> 02:14:51,456
Now we've converted that to JavaScript by using a global variable like this.

3747
02:14:51,866 --> 02:14:52,616
In the code here,

3748
02:14:52,625 --> 02:14:53,425
what's happening?

3749
02:14:53,585 --> 02:14:53,596
Well,

3750
02:14:53,706 --> 02:14:56,985
apparently there's going to be a text box at the at the top of the page that we see.

3751
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:59,790
Then there's an empty unordered list,

3752
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,549
so an empty bulleted list,

3753
02:15:01,759 --> 02:15:03,430
and then there's this code down here.

3754
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:07,870
I'm apparently creating a variable called input that's referencing that text box.

3755
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:11,600
I'm then listening for key up just as like we've done before,

3756
02:15:11,759 --> 02:15:12,750
and then I'm doing this.

3757
02:15:12,819 --> 02:15:15,930
I'm setting a variable called HTML equal to quote unquote nothing,

3758
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:17,310
so an empty string,

3759
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:18,439
and then I'm checking,

3760
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:21,640
does the input text box have any value implicitly.

3761
02:15:22,069 --> 02:15:22,560
If so,

3762
02:15:22,629 --> 02:15:23,569
what am I doing?

3763
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:24,390
This is kind of cool.

3764
02:15:24,430 --> 02:15:27,100
It's a bit of Python and C together syntactically.

3765
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:29,740
For each word in the words array,

3766
02:15:30,069 --> 02:15:33,419
JavaScript uses the keyword of instead of in like Python,

3767
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:34,259
but so be it.

3768
02:15:34,509 --> 02:15:36,950
What I'm doing now is in JavaScript I'm saying if that

3769
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:40,419
current word in that big file of 100,000 words starts with

3770
02:15:40,709 --> 02:15:42,270
whatever the user typed in.

3771
02:15:42,770 --> 02:15:43,560
Go ahead

3772
02:15:43,729 --> 02:15:47,339
and add to that HTML string using plus equals,

3773
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:48,569
which is just concatenation,

3774
02:15:48,609 --> 02:15:49,839
we've seen plus before,

3775
02:15:50,129 --> 02:15:52,459
the following an LI tag

3776
02:15:53,049 --> 02:15:55,169
inside of which is that specific word.

3777
02:15:55,629 --> 02:15:57,839
And so in effect what you're seeing now is what every,

3778
02:15:58,259 --> 02:16:00,100
almost every website nowadays does.

3779
02:16:00,299 --> 02:16:03,450
They're not manually writing HTML like we've been doing much of today.

3780
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:06,470
They're writing code that dynamically generates HTML

3781
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:08,370
because the programmers understand what HTML is.

3782
02:16:08,419 --> 02:16:12,209
They understand that unordered lists have LI children

3783
02:16:12,209 --> 02:16:14,500
and so using this string that I've highlighted,

3784
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:17,020
they're creating LI elements after LI element

3785
02:16:17,339 --> 02:16:21,240
for the purpose of changing the inner HTML of the.

3786
02:16:21,470 --> 02:16:25,890
UL element to be the value of that variable and this is

3787
02:16:25,890 --> 02:16:30,200
a very long way of saying how is autocomplete implemented in general.

3788
02:16:30,410 --> 02:16:30,450
Well,

3789
02:16:30,529 --> 02:16:33,049
just like this if I search for cats by typing in C,

3790
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:36,480
there's every word in that 100,000 dictionary that starts with C,

3791
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:37,280
A,

3792
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:38,049
T,

3793
02:16:38,468 --> 02:16:38,849
S,

3794
02:16:38,919 --> 02:16:42,129
and there's every word that starts with C A T S.

3795
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:43,089
Meanwhile,

3796
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:46,959
watch what happens underneath the hood if I open up my inspect tab again

3797
02:16:47,129 --> 02:16:50,410
and I go to my body.

3798
02:16:50,919 --> 02:16:52,660
Inside of this is the empty UL,

3799
02:16:52,759 --> 02:16:55,150
but watch as soon as I start typing something like C,

3800
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:59,080
now I can expand the triangle because there is an LI element that's been

3801
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:03,910
created for every one of the words that match as I do ATS.

3802
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,468
Now I've got just 4 of them,

3803
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:06,718
and there is cats,

3804
02:17:06,769 --> 02:17:08,019
there is catski.

3805
02:17:08,468 --> 02:17:09,370
And so forth.

3806
02:17:09,490 --> 02:17:12,370
So any time you go to google.com like we did earlier,

3807
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:16,250
we went to Google.com and started searching for CATS.

3808
02:17:16,379 --> 02:17:17,940
Where are all of those search results coming from?

3809
02:17:18,058 --> 02:17:20,610
Someone wrote JavaScript that's listening for keyU or the like,

3810
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:23,900
and then dynamically populating an unordered list or in this

3811
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:27,519
case a much prettier list of the matching results.

3812
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:29,700
And the final example that we thought we'd leave you with,

3813
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:30,099
and again,

3814
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:32,379
the whole purpose of introducing JavaScript is to give you

3815
02:17:32,379 --> 02:17:34,888
a taste of its syntax and its relative familiarity,

3816
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:35,660
but with the.

3817
02:17:36,019 --> 02:17:38,320
that you can the power with which you can

3818
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:40,629
leverage it to make websites so much more interactive.

3819
02:17:40,679 --> 02:17:44,230
And in fact with Bootstrap you don't just get CSS you can use,

3820
02:17:44,269 --> 02:17:46,679
you have a whole set of JavaScript functionalities so

3821
02:17:46,679 --> 02:17:48,549
you can have drop down menus and the like.

3822
02:17:48,759 --> 02:17:49,440
For instance,

3823
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:49,990
for instance,

3824
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,718
among the things you'll use for an upcoming

3825
02:17:51,718 --> 02:17:53,509
problem set and perhaps your final project,

3826
02:17:53,759 --> 02:17:56,299
something that looks a little like this

3827
02:17:56,799 --> 02:17:57,480
in bootstrap.

3828
02:17:57,599 --> 02:17:58,290
HTML.

3829
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:02,959
Here's a whole bunch of code that I literally copied and pasted from Bootstraps.

3830
02:18:03,068 --> 02:18:05,739
Documentation and it's just like boilerplate code for

3831
02:18:05,739 --> 02:18:08,329
a corporate website that has features with pricing

3832
02:18:08,539 --> 02:18:11,727
and disabled menu options as well just for the sake of discussion.

3833
02:18:11,939 --> 02:18:14,329
And then here if I go back into this example

3834
02:18:14,619 --> 02:18:15,529
you'll see

3835
02:18:15,939 --> 02:18:17,008
fairly simple

3836
02:18:17,539 --> 02:18:18,727
website that looks like this,

3837
02:18:18,818 --> 02:18:22,888
a so called Nav bar with all of the main menu options of like a corporate website

3838
02:18:23,098 --> 02:18:25,218
and notice if you start to resize the window,

3839
02:18:25,258 --> 02:18:27,338
which I'll do here and put it into sort of

3840
02:18:27,338 --> 02:18:30,189
mobile mode because it's so narrow now thanks to JavaScript.

3841
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:32,950
It's listening for clicks on this hamburger menu

3842
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:34,910
and revealing the menu options that way.

3843
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:39,190
This is quite like how CS 50's own website works and so many other websites out there.

3844
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:42,558
But the last one we thought we'd use is you're so in the habit of using

3845
02:18:42,558 --> 02:18:46,669
Google Maps or Uber Eats or any number of apps that need to know your location,

3846
02:18:46,919 --> 02:18:50,269
that too is exposed through JavaScript quite simply.

3847
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:52,839
Let me go ahead and in geolocation.

3848
02:18:52,968 --> 02:18:53,950
HTML,

3849
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:57,620
open up the following code whereby

3850
02:18:58,558 --> 02:18:59,379
Super simple,

3851
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:00,860
even though some new functions,

3852
02:19:01,019 --> 02:19:04,888
there exists another global variable in JavaScript in browsers called Navigator,

3853
02:19:05,179 --> 02:19:07,299
which has a property called an object called

3854
02:19:07,299 --> 02:19:10,370
geolocation which has a function called get current position

3855
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:13,429
that takes an argument which is just an anonymous function,

3856
02:19:13,459 --> 02:19:16,339
which means call this code when you're ready to know the coordinates

3857
02:19:16,339 --> 02:19:19,299
because it might take a while to figure out your GPS coordinates.

3858
02:19:19,379 --> 02:19:20,330
And once you do,

3859
02:19:20,419 --> 02:19:22,379
this simple example is just going to write

3860
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:24,860
to the document that is the rectangular page.

3861
02:19:25,250 --> 02:19:27,870
The positions latitude that comes back and

3862
02:19:27,870 --> 02:19:29,740
the position's longitude that comes back.

3863
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:31,058
So to see this in action,

3864
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:33,259
let me go ahead and uh open up

3865
02:19:33,549 --> 02:19:34,700
that second tab,

3866
02:19:35,190 --> 02:19:37,379
go back into

3867
02:19:37,589 --> 02:19:39,179
geolocation.

3868
02:19:39,939 --> 02:19:41,529
It's notice for privacy sake,

3869
02:19:41,568 --> 02:19:42,928
it's asking me to approve this,

3870
02:19:43,008 --> 02:19:44,838
so I'm gonna say allow this time.

3871
02:19:45,128 --> 02:19:47,968
There are apparently my laptop's GPS coordinates,

3872
02:19:48,008 --> 02:19:49,878
and if I go to Google Maps.com,

3873
02:19:50,088 --> 02:19:51,678
I can actually paste this in here,

3874
02:19:51,888 --> 02:19:52,678
enter,

3875
02:19:53,249 --> 02:19:53,958
and.

3876
02:19:54,519 --> 02:19:56,110
Looks like if we zoom in,

3877
02:19:56,179 --> 02:19:56,559
in,

3878
02:19:56,679 --> 02:19:56,990
in,

3879
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:57,440
OK,

3880
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:58,679
I'm not technically outside,

3881
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:00,919
so it's only close to a degree of precision,

3882
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:03,290
but it's probably mapping to one of the Wi Fi

3883
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:05,410
access points that's on that corner of the building,

3884
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,709
so we're pretty darn close,

3885
02:20:06,919 --> 02:20:09,990
pretty much close enough to get me my my food or my,

3886
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,990
my ride here.

3887
02:20:11,469 --> 02:20:12,620
And a final note,

3888
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:14,459
now that you've seen a little bit of JavaScript,

3889
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:17,780
let me go ahead and open up just 60 final seconds

3890
02:20:18,059 --> 02:20:19,410
of just how,

3891
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:22,139
how much effort it took us to put not only this lecture

3892
02:20:22,139 --> 02:20:25,860
together but particularly that example of the teaching fellows passing packets.

3893
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:28,730
Everything we like to think is very finely flourished here,

3894
02:20:29,179 --> 02:20:31,099
but here's a little bit of behind the scenes in these final

3895
02:20:31,099 --> 02:20:34,669
60 seconds together if we could dim the lights before we adjourn.

3896
02:20:36,110 --> 02:20:36,120
OK.

3897
02:20:37,429 --> 02:20:37,919
Buffering,

3898
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:38,379
OK.

3899
02:20:40,230 --> 02:20:40,740
Gosh

3900
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,759
That's Moy got,

3901
02:20:49,919 --> 02:20:50,040
no,

3902
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:50,950
oh wait.

3903
02:20:56,759 --> 02:20:57,360
That was amazing,

3904
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:57,910
Josh.

3905
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:00,490
But

3906
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:02,360
Um,

3907
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:03,169
Sophie.

3908
02:21:10,019 --> 02:21:10,809
Amazing.

3909
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,580
That was perfect.

3910
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:15,169
For me?

3911
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:19,280
I think I

3912
02:21:23,589 --> 02:21:24,000
Thanks.

3913
02:21:28,830 --> 02:21:29,860
That was amazing.

3914
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:30,940
Thank you all.

3915
02:21:32,669 --> 02:21:32,679
All

3916
02:21:33,589 --> 02:21:33,740
right.

3917
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:35,049
That's it for CS 50.

3918
02:21:35,059 --> 02:21:36,179
We'll see you next time.
