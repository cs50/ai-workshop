0
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:44,840
Alright,

1
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,650
this is CS 50 week 10.

2
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:51,150
The very end and we will end today's class just as we ended week zero,

3
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,830
which is a little bit of cake outside in the transept.

4
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:55,590
But over these past 10+ weeks,

5
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,549
if you've been feeling like it was that proverbial fire hose sort

6
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:01,000
of hitting you in the face with so much new content,

7
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,020
so many new skills,

8
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,139
so many new challenges,

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,389
um,

10
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:06,430
realize that you're in very good company and we can officially declare

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,470
nonetheless that if you started the class among those less comfortable,

12
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,589
you are officially after today no longer less comfortable.

13
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:14,949
You're at least somewhere in between and if you were in between.

14
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,795
You're more comfortable and if you were more comfortable,

15
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:19,236
you're perhaps now most comfortable among those here.

16
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,405
But keep in mind as for CS 50 syllabus,

17
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,526
what does ultimately matter in this course is not so

18
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:25,405
much where you end up relative to your classmates,

19
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:26,685
but where you end up

20
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,636
relative to where you yourself began,

21
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,765
and that's taken into account come final projects,

22
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:32,566
come final grades,

23
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:33,405
but most importantly,

24
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:36,246
that's really what's most important educationally in general

25
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:38,005
is that Delta from week 0 to,

26
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,236
in our case here now,

27
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:40,195
week 10.

28
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,085
So if it's any reassurance.

29
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:44,541
And something I like to bring up around this time is just how

30
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,222
badly I did in CS 50 and like the very first problem set.

31
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:50,692
Like I didn't even get Hello world right somehow in the fall of 1996.

32
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,382
So here's a photograph of my homework assignment for assignment one.

33
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,501
It was a program to print Hello World on the screen.

34
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,342
I was incredibly detailed with my comments,

35
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:00,821
even commenting that Maine is Maine,

36
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,342
which is not the way you're supposed to program,

37
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,891
even telling the TF where my file ended,

38
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,372
which is not really necessary,

39
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,132
and I got -2 for not even following directions.

40
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:09,917
Correctly,

41
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:15,296
so take some comfort in that even if by problems at 9 you're still getting points off,

42
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:16,186
you're hopefully,

43
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,067
at least in my case,

44
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:18,397
in some very good company.

45
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:22,026
It only gets better and easier and faster in time.

46
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,557
But the whole course ultimately has really been about this picture,

47
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:24,837
right?

48
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,727
Problem solving is computer science and you have inputs,

49
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:28,757
which is the problem to be solved.

50
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,156
You have the outputs that you want to get to,

51
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:32,347
which is presumably the solutions there too.

52
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,397
And inside of that proverbial black box are these algorithms,

53
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:36,317
step by step instruction.

54
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,764
For solving some problem,

55
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:42,563
and I pulled up my own notes from CS 50's first lecture some 25 plus years ago too,

56
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:45,233
where I wrote down this in my horrible writing,

57
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,373
handwriting to this day,

58
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,134
but I noted that what an algorithm is is

59
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,533
a precise sequence of steps for getting something done,

60
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,244
which is pretty much what we now say.

61
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,604
I noted that programming itself,

62
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:55,694
as we have for weeks now,

63
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,044
is the process of taking an algorithm and putting

64
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,444
it into a language that computer can process,

65
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,054
and that's what you've done in Scratch and C,

66
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:03,453
and Python and SQL and Java.

67
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,229
and anything in between,

68
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,389
and most important,

69
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,940
at least my takeaway that day

70
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,100
when it comes to algorithms is precision

71
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:11,139
and correctness,

72
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,080
and indeed those are points we've made perhaps not as emphatically

73
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,949
over the past several weeks as well.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,020
But we thought we'd see

75
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,300
just how much those two lessons in particular have sunk in,

76
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,210
by doing a bit of an exercise,

77
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,699
some CS 50 pictionary in this,

78
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,460
our last lecture altogether this term,

79
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:25,750
um,

80
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,589
for which to begin we need one brave volunteer to come on upstage.

81
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:34,490
Who would like to volunteer?

82
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,869
Who,

83
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:35,320
how about,

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,520
OK,

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,000
over here,

86
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,449
we never call from the middle of the section,

87
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,270
come on up,

88
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:38,960
come on up,

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,350
a round of applause for

90
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,649
being so brave.

91
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,600
Nice.

92
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:45,710
All right,

93
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,990
come on over.

94
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,990
And

95
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,809
In just a moment,

96
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,979
let's go ahead and do introductions.

97
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:57,220
First,

98
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,660
if you want to come up over to the middle of the stage

99
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,570
and introduce yourself to the world.

100
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,490
Hi,

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,220
I'm Jia.

102
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,369
I'm a freshman.

103
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:04,800
All right,

104
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,050
nice,

105
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:05,699
nice to meet you.

106
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,570
Thank you for joining us.

107
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,059
So what we're about to do is Gia's going to look at my

108
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,130
screen where there's going to be a picture on a white screen.

109
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,220
All of you presumably have a white sheet of paper in

110
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,449
front of you that you grabbed on the way in.

111
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:15,850
If you don't.

112
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:18,445
Just grab one from a friend or your binder or the like,

113
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:19,445
and if you really don't,

114
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:20,464
that's OK too,

115
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:23,524
but hopefully everyone has a pen or pencil or someone near you does.

116
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,654
And what we're going to ask you to do is program the

117
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,804
audience to draw what it is you see on the screen.

118
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:31,684
You can say anything you want,

119
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,265
but you may not use any physical gestures or the like,

120
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,804
verbal programming only.

121
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:36,295
OK.

122
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:36,575
All right,

123
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:37,904
come on over to the lectern.

124
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,170
And in just a moment,

125
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,859
GN only Gia will see what is actually here on the screen.

126
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,609
So.

127
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,829
Step 1 for your audience.

128
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,269
OK,

129
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,390
so the first thing that you need to do

130
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,480
is draw two lines right next to each other,

131
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,950
2 vertical lines.

132
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:00,540
OK.

133
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:00,559
OK.

134
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,739
Step 2,

135
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:04,880
once you have done that,

136
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,980
you need to draw

137
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,739
3 dots,

138
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,959
one on

139
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,869
above those two vertical lines,

140
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:13,690
one right in the middle between those two vertical lines,

141
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:14,309
and one

142
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:17,959
on the bottom of these 3 vertical lines beneath

143
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,820
those two vertical lines.

144
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,190
Yeah,

145
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,309
so 3 dots.

146
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:22,290
OK.

147
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,059
Step 3.

148
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:28,700
Step 3 is on the top of the left vertical line,

149
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,260
you're gonna connect

150
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,459
a line from that position

151
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,320
to the top dot that you drew

152
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,679
and then on the top of the right

153
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,859
vertical line,

154
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,420
you're gonna connect

155
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,910
that position to the top dot that you drew.

156
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,399
All right,

157
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,160
step 4

158
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,239
is,

159
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,880
remember that top left position?

160
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,380
You're going to connect that to

161
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,250
the middle dot that you drew.

162
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,059
And then the top right of the vertical line,

163
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:00,850
uh,

164
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,350
the,

165
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:01,619
yes,

166
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,700
you're going to connect that to the middle dot of the line that you drew.

167
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:05,570
Mhm.

168
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,480
And then step 5

169
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,750
on the

170
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:12,859
bottom left of your left vertical line,

171
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,220
you're gonna connect that position

172
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:18,019
to the bottom dot that you drew

173
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,140
and then

174
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,619
on the bottom right

175
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,619
of the right vertical line you're gonna connect that

176
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,510
position to the bottom dot that you drew.

177
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,630
And now from the middle dot to the bottom dot you should have no line in between that,

178
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,880
and you can now draw a line between those two dots.

179
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,459
Step 6 and the last.

180
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,649
I think you should be done.

181
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,059
All right,

182
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,609
a round of applause for our programmer.

183
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,100
Let me give you a little something.

184
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
If you want to take a seat,

185
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:48,140
well,

186
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,609
now what Kelly and I are going to do

187
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,820
is very quickly collect your execution of this program,

188
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,980
and we'll see just how it went with Gia as the programmer.

189
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,929
If you want to just reach out and hand me or Kelly over there any of your

190
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:01,779
handwritings,

191
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,619
we don't need all of them,

192
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,010
just a representative sample will suffice.

193
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:06,940
If you're proud of your work,

194
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,820
extend your hand quite a bit.

195
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,510
OK,

196
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,420
very proud.

197
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,260
OK.

198
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,700
OK.

199
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,510
OK,

200
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:14,869
OK,

201
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,329
one more,

202
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:15,750
one more,

203
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:16,739
that's OK.

204
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:17,149
All right,

205
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,179
I'm gonna run back to the stage.

206
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,029
OK.

207
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,149
It's OK if we didn't grab yours.

208
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:24,750
All right.

209
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:33,940
All right,

210
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,950
thank you to Kelly for grabbing these as well.

211
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:36,339
So,

212
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,250
without having seen any of these,

213
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,609
here is how you all interpreted

214
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:42,380
Gia's instructions.

215
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,410
So here's one

216
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:44,899
interpretation.

217
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:46,350
OK.

218
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,859
Perhaps similar or different from your own.

219
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:49,619
Uh,

220
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,459
here's another several.

221
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,170
Vertical vertical line,

222
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,809
question mark,

223
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,500
OK.

224
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,140
He is.

225
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,390
Very narrow one.

226
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,190
All right,

227
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,829
and

228
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,579
And let's see if we got any other variants thereof.

229
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,010
Actually,

230
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,160
the rest of them

231
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,089
are pretty consistent.

232
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,369
So,

233
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:13,649
gee,

234
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,600
if it's any

235
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,570
reassurance,

236
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,829
I'm seeing a lot of ones that look

237
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,420
like this.

238
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,029
Here's another that looks like

239
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,369
this

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,950
and here's yet another that looks like

241
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,829
this.

242
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,989
So if you're wondering where we're going with this,

243
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,789
if I go ahead and reveal what it was Gia was looking at on the screen,

244
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,270
she was in fact having you draw this here

245
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,590
cube.

246
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,760
So some of the takeaways here.

247
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,669
So suffice to say,

248
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,830
not all of that went well,

249
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,159
uh,

250
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,960
but why was that?

251
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,090
Well,

252
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,150
I dare say it was very easy to get confused,

253
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,400
I think,

254
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:45,440
G,

255
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,359
in some of your words because you had in your

256
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,239
mind's eye exactly what it was you were drawing and.

257
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,947
Of course it was right there on the screen,

258
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,168
but we didn't leverage,

259
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,518
at least in GSA instructions,

260
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:54,598
any abstractions.

261
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,598
I dare say it might have been a little bit easier for all

262
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,747
of us if maybe she had just teed things up by saying,

263
00:08:58,918 --> 00:08:59,168
All right,

264
00:08:59,317 --> 00:08:59,398
everyone,

265
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,408
we're going to draw a cube,

266
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,078
for instance,

267
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,278
which is indeed an abstraction over these lower

268
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,168
level details that she was focusing on.

269
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:09,237
But perhaps there could have been another approach altogether,

270
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:11,278
which is even more pedantic.

271
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:11,797
For instance,

272
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:14,038
a lot of the earliest drawing programs.

273
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,125
And even worlds like Scratch sort of take for granted that you have

274
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,395
a coordinate system like X's and Y's and you can go up,

275
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:19,565
down,

276
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:20,205
left and right.

277
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,046
So an alternative to just saying,

278
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:22,245
hey,

279
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:23,596
I'll draw a cube,

280
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,676
which could be subject to interpretation because there's a cube like this,

281
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,245
is it like this rotated so we still would have

282
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,755
needed more information than just a cube from Gia.

283
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,046
But here maybe an alternative approach would have been

284
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:36,046
to really get into the weeds and say put

285
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:40,723
your pen at the top of the page and then draw a Straight line to the southwest,

286
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,354
for instance,

287
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,994
and then draw another line of the same distance to the south and then to

288
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:48,354
the southeast or so forth and it could have been in terms of degrees,

289
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,883
it could be directionally in that way,

290
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,773
but it might not have been clear to anyone what it was we were

291
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,484
drawing until enough of the lines suddenly appear on the screen and then voila,

292
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:58,783
you see that we've been drawing a cube this whole time.

293
00:09:58,854 --> 00:10:03,624
So the degree to which we're precise and the layer of the level of abstraction that

294
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:05,942
operate in is incredibly important whether it's

295
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,341
for another human to understand us,

296
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,401
for an AI to understand us nowadays,

297
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,492
or anything in between.

298
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:11,901
All right,

299
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,841
why don't we go ahead and flip things around a bit

300
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,052
um for this,

301
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,262
why don't we go ahead and get one

302
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:20,002
more volunteer to do something a little different here

303
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:21,591
on stage?

304
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:22,781
One more OK,

305
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,942
how about here on the aisle?

306
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:24,692
Come on down.

307
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:27,091
Round of applause for this brave volunteer.

308
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,262
Come on down.

309
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,669
All right.

310
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
So in this exercise,

311
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,080
we're gonna flip things around.

312
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,520
So you all will be giving the instructions verbally by

313
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,909
just shouting them out and our volunteer whose name is

314
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,039
Preston.

315
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:42,219
Presley.

316
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,659
Presley,

317
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:43,020
Presley,

318
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,289
you want to say a quick introduction?

319
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:44,619
Yeah,

320
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:44,820
uh,

321
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:45,739
my name is Presley.

322
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm a freshman,

323
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,070
uh,

324
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,090
living in Stton House.

325
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:48,299
Nice.

326
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,500
Well,

327
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:48,890
welcome.

328
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,909
Come on over to the,

329
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:50,119
the,

330
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,539
uh,

331
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,369
the easel here,

332
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,929
and we have a black marker for Presley here.

333
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,619
And the only thing that we ask is that you not look up or

334
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,599
behind you because the answer is going to be Right there on the screen,

335
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,750
but everyone else is welcome to look up or over to the TV screen.

336
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,679
And if you want to go ahead and face the easel here and as you draw,

337
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,760
just make sure to kind of open up after each stroke of

338
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,880
the pen so that everyone can see what you have done.

339
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,320
All right,

340
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,229
so no looking up as of now because what the audience is about to do

341
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:22,049
is to program you to draw this on the screen.

342
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,640
Oh,

343
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,559
way to encourage him.

344
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:23,960
OK,

345
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:24,510
so

346
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,630
step one,

347
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,000
feel free to just raise your hand and we'll shout them out.

348
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,570
I heard draw circle over here,

349
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,659
but not too big,

350
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,049
I heard over here.

351
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,570
Good abstraction,

352
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,690
you're gonna end up drawing a stick figure.

353
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,000
But we should probably be a little more helpful than that.

354
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,659
So let's do the hand thing just so we can be more

355
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,179
precise and not overwhelm Presley with the was the hand over here,

356
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,280
yeah,

357
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,109
and back.

358
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,130
Draw a line down from the circle,

359
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:53,760
Presley.

360
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,770
From the bottom of the circle.

361
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,270
OK,

362
00:11:59,469 --> 00:11:59,909
someone else?

363
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:03,940
So actually,

364
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,250
let me,

365
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,239
let me rewind,

366
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:05,590
sorry,

367
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:06,299
say it again.

368
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,630
Draw two diagonal lines from the line you just drew.

369
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:15,349
Well,

370
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:16,429
I don't think the audience likes this.

371
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:16,630
Wait,

372
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,059
let's,

373
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,500
uh,

374
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,080
mm.

375
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,530
OK.

376
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:20,950
OK,

377
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:22,700
that's what we were told.

378
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:23,640
Next step,

379
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:24,479
someone else?

380
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:25,969
So

381
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:29,340
OK.

382
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,609
Good one.

383
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,219
OK.

384
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,359
Extends the original vertical line to be about the same height as the circle.

385
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,700
OK,

386
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:41,940
yeah,

387
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,380
that's good,

388
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,059
good feedback.

389
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:43,340
All right,

390
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:44,210
someone else.

391
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,419
Next step.

392
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:47,640
Next step.

393
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,590
Yes.

394
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,369
Nice.

395
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,039
Draw two diagonal lines from the bottom of that line that look like legs,

396
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,340
good use of

397
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,390
detail and abstraction.

398
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:06,750
OK,

399
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:07,650
nice.

400
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:08,299
Next step.

401
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:10,950
Anyone?

402
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,690
We're close.

403
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,020
Yeah,

404
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,809
over here.

405
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,059
On the left.

406
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,580
So you're gonna draw a speech bubble to the left of the head with the word high,

407
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,539
capital H with a short line.

408
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,330
No bubble,

409
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,039
just high.

410
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,309
And you wanted to clarify one other detail.

411
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,130
A line from high to the face,

412
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,099
with space in

413
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,090
between.

414
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:49,979
OK,

415
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:50,260
no,

416
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:50,979
you're doing great,

417
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:51,460
it's OK,

418
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:51,989
Presley.

419
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,460
Hang in there.

420
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,820
OK,

421
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,080
final step or two.

422
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:57,669
Next step,

423
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,969
Anyone at all

424
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,570
Feel free to shout it out.

425
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,179
Adjust the arms to make them look like they're running.

426
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:15,260
Good luck.

427
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh,

428
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:21,880
I like that.

429
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,460
Draw a perpendicular line from the left arm.

430
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,260
To the bottom.

431
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,179
OK.

432
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,260
And lastly,

433
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,289
one final step.

434
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:36,109
No.

435
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,080
Same side.

436
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:40,570
Yeah,

437
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,359
it's permanent.

438
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,010
Uh.

439
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,659
I think we need a final touch on the other arm,

440
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:46,929
maybe,

441
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,260
yes,

442
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,250
one final step.

443
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,280
Anyone?

444
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:01,520
Draw a perpendicular line per uh diagonally to the left.

445
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,880
Of the right arm

446
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,000
Mm

447
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,799
Just a little bit.

448
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,419
All right,

449
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:15,960
I think I've,

450
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,059
I think we've withheld our applause long enough.

451
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:18,419
Presley,

452
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,030
if you want to take a step back and look at what you,

453
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,849
they were trying to get you to draw

454
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,849
a round of applause.

455
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,570
So here too,

456
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,000
let me,

457
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:28,679
here you go,

458
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,190
your dorm room if you would like.

459
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,150
OK.

460
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,799
And a little Super Mario as well.

461
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:34,760
All right,

462
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,789
so here too,

463
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,190
um,

464
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,619
I think you were the problem this time.

465
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,090
Round of applause for Presley.

466
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,280
And of course since it's,

467
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:41,479
you know,

468
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,200
permanent ink,

469
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,840
it's easy to sort of go off the rails early on and make a mistake,

470
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,359
but I think that was actually a nice mix of low level details

471
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:51,119
like the directions of the lines and the lengths thereof and also some

472
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:54,440
abstractions because I do dare say someone shouting out that it is to

473
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,859
be a stick figure gave him a much more helpful mental model.

474
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,539
So that might be sort of the comments on top of the function,

475
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:03,109
but when we really got into the weeds of implementing that function,

476
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,799
it was more akin to step by step instructions for solving this here.

477
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:08,848
Particular problem.

478
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:13,468
So my thanks to Presley for bearing with us with that one as well.

479
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:14,677
So

480
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:16,148
beyond this,

481
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:18,918
where have we been up until now?

482
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:19,427
So,

483
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:20,107
uh,

484
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,357
if we look back at the past several weeks,

485
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:24,028
this is sort of the trajectory on which,

486
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:24,388
uh,

487
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:24,947
we've been.

488
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:27,028
So we started with scratch from scratch,

489
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,388
literally in the very first week,

490
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:32,158
the goal of VoI was to introduce you to some of those procedural fundamentals like

491
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,598
what a loop is and a conditional and

492
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:35,638
Boolean expressions and variables which are pretty.

493
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:39,835
Much recurred in different forms and different languages over the weeks

494
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,875
since thereafter we transition to a more traditional language C,

495
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:46,755
which many of you will never use again and admittedly even I only use

496
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,796
it for like a month or two of the year during CS 50 itself,

497
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:53,476
but the intent was to be this incredibly foundational language that

498
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:55,995
so many other languages today are built on top of.

499
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:56,806
Case in point,

500
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,875
the interpreter that you might use for Python itself can

501
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,395
be written in C and that speaks to how we sort of talked.

502
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,503
Bootstrapping from one language to another,

503
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,663
from low level to high level and beyond,

504
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,303
arrays and algorithms,

505
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:11,553
all of that and memory and data structures like

506
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:13,693
all of that is sort of omnipresent in computing,

507
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:15,124
in programming and the like,

508
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:18,263
even though you might not need to in modern languages like Python,

509
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:22,354
worry as much about managing your own memory because good programmers,

510
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:25,354
better programmers have figured out how to solve those problems for you

511
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,784
in the language itself or in the libraries that you're using.

512
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:31,114
You can take for granted now that you at least know what a hash table is.

513
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:32,102
What a linked list is,

514
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:33,352
what the trade-offs are among those,

515
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:34,462
what the running times are,

516
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:37,312
and that's what computer scientists and software engineers

517
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:39,751
think about and talk about and whiteboard about in

518
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:42,232
the real world when trying to implement algorithms

519
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:44,991
of their own to real world problems or implementing

520
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,271
real world products.

521
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:47,942
And then of course over the past few weeks

522
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,511
we've sort of used that as a stepping

523
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:51,871
stone to talk about very modern programming paradigms,

524
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,121
most recently web programming,

525
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,342
and even though we didn't use it explicitly in the class,

526
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,911
mobile programming is increasingly based on HTML and CSS.

527
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,900
And JavaScript,

528
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,130
which might be something some of you will tackle for your own final projects,

529
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:05,030
and you can't escape now using or

530
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,500
seeing or leveraging somehow artificial intelligence.

531
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,550
And among the goals for today is to at least

532
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,819
point you in the direction of tools that now,

533
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,140
having finished Problem set 9,

534
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,989
you are welcome and encouraged to use for your final project so that

535
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:20,709
you can build all the more and all the more successfully than even

536
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,270
some of your predecessors just a few years ago could have now that

537
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,630
your own work and your own know-how can be amplified by the impact.

538
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:28,297
Of AI itself.

539
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,817
This of course now brings us to today,

540
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:31,417
the end,

541
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:34,478
but wanted to give you a sense of where you can go here on out.

542
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:35,647
So with your final project,

543
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,338
this really is the the intent of the final project is to be the

544
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:43,468
very first of hopefully many projects that you decide to spec out for yourself.

545
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,218
Like every problem set thus far has been written by me and the team,

546
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:48,657
and you've been following our instructions step by step.

547
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,177
The Frontal Project takes all of those training wheels off,

548
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:53,878
and even though you are welcome and encouraged to borrow,

549
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:54,427
code.

550
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:57,745
From say problem set 9 if you want to do something web-based or even earlier,

551
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:00,536
if you want to do something that's more similar to past Pets,

552
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,296
is to make it ultimately your own.

553
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:03,176
And even if you want,

554
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,566
start with a completely empty window and just a

555
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,416
blinking prompt and build something of your own,

556
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:08,855
um,

557
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:09,855
setting out for yourself,

558
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:11,536
as you've seen in the specification,

559
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:14,936
a good goal which you intend to meet no matter what,

560
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:15,625
a better goal,

561
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,465
which is a bit more of a stretch and a best goal,

562
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:21,095
which in practice rarely ever happens with software to this day,

563
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:22,145
25 years since.

564
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,734
Taking CS 50 myself,

565
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:24,063
um,

566
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:24,973
or plus now,

567
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:25,463
um,

568
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,014
even I consistently underappreciate just how long

569
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:30,943
it takes sometimes to solve problems,

570
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:32,254
but that's beginning to go away,

571
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:34,573
at least to some extent thanks to AI,

572
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,663
where at least now you essentially have a junior colleague

573
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:39,913
next to you who can help solve bugs for you,

574
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:40,953
point you in the right direction,

575
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:41,854
even tackle

576
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,134
features as well.

577
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:43,524
Um,

578
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:46,713
all that we ask for this final project is that you build something of interest to you,

579
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:47,933
that you solve an actual problem,

580
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,303
that you input to campus,

581
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:49,994
or that you.

582
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,140
As we say in the spec,

583
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,619
change the world and try to achieve something,

584
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,459
try to create something that outlives the

585
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,979
course itself over these final few weeks of

586
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:01,760
the class and even continue on with it if you'd like in January and beyond.

587
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,739
So what are the support structures in place and how might you go about this?

588
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,739
So a long standing tradition of CS 50 is this epic late nighter,

589
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,119
the CS 50 hackathon,

590
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,810
where by

591
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:12,459
around 7 p.m. we'll serve some pizza around.

592
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,956
p.m. we'll serve some ice cream,

593
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,916
and if you're still awake come midnight when the event will start to wrap,

594
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,995
we'll get in a whole bunch of CS 50 shuttles,

595
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:21,715
drive down the road to the International House of Pancakes,

596
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:22,926
which is open 24/7,

597
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,105
and have some breakfast together if you choose,

598
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:30,125
with some pancakes together at this local IHOP.

599
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,235
Here are just a few visuals from the past year's

600
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:35,036
hackathon of students gathering in the engineering building across campus.

601
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:35,641
Um,

602
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,222
here having some of that same pizza

603
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:41,962
and here still being awake at uh early morning hours as well.

604
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:42,241
uh,

605
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,452
to paint a picture of this too,

606
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:44,092
the team

607
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,082
a few years back kindly put together a video,

608
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:49,572
a sort of sizzle video that paints a picture of what it might

609
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:52,582
be like if you at least were a Muppett attending this year,

610
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:52,871
uh,

611
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:53,962
CS 50 hackathon.

612
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,682
If we could go ahead and dim the lights,

613
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,641
I think we can go ahead and play,

614
00:20:58,171 --> 00:20:58,541
uh,

615
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:01,881
this teaser of what awaits later this week.

616
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:04,011
Just one night all we got.

617
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,369
Just one night,

618
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,040
all we got.

619
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,089
Just one night.

620
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:08,790
Does

621
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,020
Still

622
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,000
On the weekend.

623
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:26,939
All

624
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:27,589
right,

625
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,069
so what then is the CSMC hack upon itself?

626
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,150
What really is the late night opportunity to dive into,

627
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,000
to start,

628
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:34,280
uh,

629
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,079
to make progress on your final project?

630
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,839
The teaching staff and I will be there on hand,

631
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,069
not so much to answer any and all questions for you,

632
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,319
but to help you help yourselves,

633
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,560
point you at resources,

634
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,349
point you at,

635
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:43,750
uh,

636
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,680
the requisite websites,

637
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,550
the documentation,

638
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,270
so as to empower you ultimately to solve this here problem,

639
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:49,790
uh,

640
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
for yourself without some of those same prior training wheels that we've had.

641
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:53,380
On,

642
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:53,569
uh,

643
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,089
the goal ultimately is to prepare you for the end of semester exhibition,

644
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,290
the so-called CS 50 fair,

645
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:00,010
which will be an opportunity to present your

646
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,229
final projects on your phones or laptops,

647
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,310
uh,

648
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,640
to passersby from

649
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,609
the faculty,

650
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:05,219
from students,

651
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:05,810
from staff,

652
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,160
from visitors all across campus here,

653
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:08,459
uh,

654
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,640
some emoji balloons will await you here,

655
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,020
uh,

656
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,199
a photo booth if you'd like to uh immortalize the the memory,

657
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:15,689
uh,

658
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,369
and the goal of the hack of the fair will be

659
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:21,339
really just a Present your projects to others that come by,

660
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:21,660
uh,

661
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:25,449
delighting in what it is you have achieved over these past few months alone,

662
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,579
and of course by the end of it you'll pick up your very own CS

663
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:33,670
50 t-shirt which says hopefully proudly that you have now indeed taken CS 50.

664
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:37,339
But let's just see in preparation for that how much has indeed sunk in.

665
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,079
We did have that test a couple of weeks back,

666
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:39,290
oh,

667
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,050
which went great,

668
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,739
but we thought we'd pluck some of these same review questions that

669
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,979
you prepared over the past couple of weeks to challenge at least.

670
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,849
6 of your classmates to come up.

671
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:47,229
Uh,

672
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,760
for now,

673
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,140
this,

674
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,339
the so-called CS 50 charades for which we need 2 teams of 3.

675
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,469
So if you're sitting there in a group of 3 of friends total,

676
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,910
or we'll form one up here live,

677
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,579
so come on up as our first volunteer,

678
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,319
needed 5 more volunteers.

679
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:03,219
Feel free to volunteer the persons next to you 3 in a row.

680
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,589
How about 2 more over here,

681
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:06,880
1 and how about 2 on the end.

682
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:07,660
Come on up.

683
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:08,000
All right,

684
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:10,910
a round of applause for these 6 year volunteers and.

685
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:14,449
All right,

686
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,119
so let me give you one microphone.

687
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,359
Let me give you a 2nd microphone and Kelly,

688
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:20,680
if you want to come on up as well.

689
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:22,609
I think these three seem to know each other already,

690
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,959
so we'll have them be one team if you guys want to be

691
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,280
another team as well.

692
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:27,040
Come on up.

693
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:27,250
Uh,

694
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,130
let me just take one microphone actually for the other team.

695
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,849
All right.

696
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,770
And how about quick introductions to this team here and

697
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,750
we first we need a team name from you all.

698
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,760
You haven't had time to think about this?

699
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:40,260
Team

700
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:42,859
A.

701
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:43,290
OK,

702
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,579
so Team A is who?

703
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,709
I'm Leah.

704
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,739
I'm a first year and I'm in Hoorthy.

705
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:49,510
Welcome.

706
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:49,910
Uh,

707
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,709
my name is Stephen.

708
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,030
I'm a freshman in.

709
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,550
I'm Charlotte.

710
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,479
I'm a freshman and I'm also in Canada.

711
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,650
All right,

712
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,550
let's do introductions on the other team as well.

713
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,869
You are going to be team.

714
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,310
Awesome sauce.

715
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:03,500
Awesome sauce,

716
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,760
OK,

717
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,910
versus Team A,

718
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,109
uh,

719
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,300
if you wanna go ahead and introduce yourselves here.

720
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:07,859
Hi,

721
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,030
my name is Jenny Pan.

722
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,739
I'm a freshman in Hollis.

723
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,540
Hi,

724
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:12,420
my name is Noah.

725
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,619
I'm a freshman in Holbut.

726
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,270
And hi,

727
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:15,989
my name is Marie,

728
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,819
and I'm a freshman,

729
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:17,189
sorry,

730
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,069
I'm a freshman in Canada B.

731
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:19,469
All right,

732
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,180
welcome to both of our teams here.

733
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,260
And among the goals now,

734
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,140
let's leave one microphone with each team,

735
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,500
uh,

736
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,550
is to play a bit of charades whereby one of you in a moment is

737
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,859
going to be responsible for acting out a word that you see on the screen.

738
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,310
So we're going to put on this screen and the screen

739
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,180
over here some term that relates to CS 50 somehow,

740
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,959
and that person's goal over the course of 60 seconds.

741
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,800
Going to be to act that out in such a way

742
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,170
that their teammates can hopefully guess what the word is.

743
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,680
We'll give you 60 seconds at a time.

744
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,839
Kelly has kindly offered to keep score,

745
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:47,260
um,

746
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,290
and if you solve it in fewer than 60 seconds,

747
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:50,650
we've got another word for you in another word,

748
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:54,010
and we'll see how many points you can accrue over the course of those 60 seconds.

749
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,040
And depending on how this goes,

750
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,459
we'll do maybe 1 or 2

751
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:57,410
rounds in total.

752
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,550
Questions.

753
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,810
How many skips do you get?

754
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:04,520
I guess you can skip uh as many as you want until we run out of questions.

755
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,609
But try not to run through all of our questions.

756
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,140
All right,

757
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,699
any questions that'll be on that.

758
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,219
All right,

759
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,160
so if you guys want to step off stage over there,

760
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,709
why don't we have team A

761
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,310
begin?

762
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,630
So one of you,

763
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:16,050
Leah,

764
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,819
if you're holding the mic,

765
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,449
if you want to be the curator,

766
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,770
let's go ahead and have you stand

767
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,670
here so you can see the screen,

768
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,609
and we only ask that you two not look up because the answer is going to be right there.

769
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,459
All right,

770
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,770
and you should just shout out,

771
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:29,089
uh,

772
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,579
the word that Lee is acting out.

773
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:30,939
Question.

774
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,329
Acting only charades speaking.

775
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,040
Yeah,

776
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,209
yeah,

777
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,319
I can't speak because that would kind of defeat the point.

778
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:36,680
So yes,

779
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,459
just acting out,

780
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,329
just acting out physically.

781
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,310
All right,

782
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,829
I'm gonna go over here.

783
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,869
Give me just a moment to get the slides ready with your questions.

784
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:46,089
And Leah,

785
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,010
the first clue,

786
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,229
oh,

787
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,229
and Kelly's gonna be timing you 60 seconds to accrue as many points as you can.

788
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:51,920
All right,

789
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:52,550
here we go.

790
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:53,949
Go

791
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,060
Act that out.

792
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,640
00,

793
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,209
that was weird,

794
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,800
thank you.

795
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:01,670
Sorry.

796
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,369
Yes,

797
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:02,849
act out,

798
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,739
this is CS 50.

799
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:03,969
All right.

800
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,130
No,

801
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:04,849
act this out,

802
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,209
please.

803
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:05,729
Go.

804
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,630
Calling a recursion.

805
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,079
Yes,

806
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:11,869
1 point.

807
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:16,619
uh,

808
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,000
in array linkless.

809
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,449
Abstraction?

810
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:24,910
Python,

811
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:25,530
Python,

812
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,819
Python.

813
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:30,459
Duck,

814
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:30,989
the duck Nice.

815
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,839
Binary

816
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,969
uh 10 binary digit.

817
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,079
Bite

818
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:44,869
10,

819
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,530
definitely binary.

820
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,890
Asky.

821
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:52,599
Want to pass

822
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:53,369
They

823
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Linkless array.

824
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:58,810
Yes,

825
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,449
array.

826
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,520
Loop loop.

827
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,209
Time.

828
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,219
All right.

829
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,130
Very nicely done.

830
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,449
All right.

831
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,699
5 is the score to beat.

832
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,609
So if you guys want to step over here,

833
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:14,900
if,

834
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:15,150
uh,

835
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,020
one of you has the mic,

836
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,250
go ahead and assume the same roles.

837
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,030
5 is the score to beat.

838
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:24,079
Alright,

839
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,599
5 is the score to beat.

840
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,069
All right,

841
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:27,910
here we go,

842
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,900
final round.

843
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,099
First word and you guys just make sure you don't look up.

844
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,150
Go.

845
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,140
Head node algorithm

846
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,660
input.

847
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:48,790
Algorithm

848
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,069
Yes

849
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,150
Well.

850
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,530
These are hard

851
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,010
No.

852
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:03,979
Sure,

853
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:04,930
you have to act it out,

854
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:05,640
act it out.

855
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,040
Oh,

856
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,609
they go.

857
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,010
Run time,

858
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:16,449
run time.

859
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,599
3.

860
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:18,859
Yes,

861
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,750
3.

862
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,380
Next one.

863
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:23,849
Next one.

864
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:30,079
Binary search binary bullying?

865
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:30,729
No.

866
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,239
A merge phone call.

867
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:36,930
It was binary search wasn't it?

868
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,050
Oh,

869
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,390
that's right,

870
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,380
but a round of applause for our awesome sauce.

871
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:47,369
OK,

872
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:48,000
we have some,

873
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:49,369
some parting prizes for you,

874
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,530
your very own Super Mario Pezs

875
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:53,000
for you guys as well.

876
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,310
I'm glad we squared away the,

877
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:56,010
the ability to pass though on the question,

878
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,319
so thank you for that.

879
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:57,729
All right,

880
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,079
so admittedly pretty hard.

881
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,040
Our thanks to all of these volunteers for playing that out.

882
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,989
Allow me to turn our attention back to here

883
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,520
in just a moment where else

884
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,150
uh we can go

885
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:10,250
from here.

886
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,520
So up until now,

887
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,449
up until now.

888
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:20,010
We've been using Visual Studio Code for CS 50 at the URL CS50.dv. Recall

889
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,920
that this is just an adaptation of a commercial tool called GitHub CodeSpaces,

890
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,040
which is like a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code itself,

891
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,989
or VS Code,

892
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,010
which is an largely open source tool

893
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,209
for Microsoft that's incredibly popular in industry,

894
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,040
which is to say,

895
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,770
even though we had the CS50 library in there and we turned

896
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,739
off by default some of the menu options and we disabled AI,

897
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,250
it is the tool that so many programmers around

898
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,369
the world do use every day to write code.

899
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,050
So you have been learning.

900
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,707
All this time sort of industry standards in that sense.

901
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:47,746
It is now time,

902
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:48,616
if you so choose,

903
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:50,737
but you are welcome to keep using this for

904
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:53,166
your final project if feeling more comfortable with it,

905
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:58,166
to drop the 4 CS 50 and actually install on your own Mac or PC if you so choose,

906
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,487
Visual Studio Code itself.

907
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:00,967
You can go to this URL here.

908
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,337
It's fairly straightforward to install it,

909
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:04,817
but invariably you'll run into

910
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:06,776
probably some technical support headaches depending

911
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:08,687
on the language that you're trying to use with it.

912
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:09,177
For instance,

913
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:10,487
if you're trying to use it with Python,

914
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:13,057
you'll probably also have to download and install Python on.

915
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:13,614
Your computer,

916
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:15,134
at least if you want the latest version,

917
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:19,063
and just know a priori that sometimes just stuff happens and it

918
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:22,014
just doesn't work and you have to Google or ask Chat GPT,

919
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:22,813
and that's fine.

920
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:24,423
And honestly that's kind of normal.

921
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:27,904
But this is also why we don't do any of this in week zero of the class

922
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:32,973
so that we can focus on Hello world and Mario and cash and credit and get into the

923
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:37,073
interesting parts of computing and programming and not frustrating,

924
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:39,874
not frustrating you so with technical support challenges.

925
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:40,413
But now,

926
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:41,984
given that all of you are somewhere in between.

927
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:43,500
are among those more comfortable,

928
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,860
you're now ready to sort of deal with those same

929
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,220
technical challenge yourself,

930
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,831
but who knows,

931
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:50,500
maybe it will go perfectly smoothly.

932
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,151
You can go to CS 50's own documentation because if you want to

933
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:56,380
be able to use all of the same software that CS50 has pre-installed,

934
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,230
you can use a technology known as

935
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,270
containerization with a tool called Docker and actually

936
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,061
run a CS50 environment on your Mac or PC or even in the cloud,

937
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,620
but still run VS code on your own Mac and PC,

938
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,990
among the upsides of which are that you're not dependent necessarily on the.

939
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,748
You can do everything offline,

940
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:14,517
which is useful in general.

941
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,958
You can do things more quickly sometimes if you're using the

942
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,677
full capabilities of your own computer and not just a browser.

943
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:22,797
So this is generally how programmers approach their code

944
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:25,677
using something like VS code or alternative products.

945
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:27,517
And in fact there's a bunch of others out there,

946
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:30,998
but perhaps the trendiest right now are these 3 here,

947
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:33,228
not just Visual Studio code itself,

948
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:34,797
but a tool called Cursor,

949
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,118
another one called Windsurf,

950
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:38,517
and there's dozens of other text editors,

951
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:39,838
often known as integrated.

952
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:42,324
Development environments which tend to have even more features that you

953
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:44,954
can download for free or commercially on your own Macs,

954
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,194
PCs and the like,

955
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:46,405
uh,

956
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:49,484
but you can't go wrong transitioning from CS 50 to VS code on

957
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:53,074
your own Mac or PC if only because you're already familiar with it.

958
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,094
As for the command line,

959
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:56,564
so those of you with Macs might have found

960
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:59,675
somewhere in your utilities folder a program called Terminal.

961
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:00,045
Um,

962
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:00,555
if not,

963
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,275
poke around there later today and you'll see that all this time

964
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:06,694
you've had a command line interface available to you on Mac OS.

965
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:08,675
Windows has something similar as well.

966
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:08,844
They they.

967
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:12,291
Necessarily come with all of the same tools that we've been using within CS50.

968
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:12,822
Dev,

969
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,612
but if you're a Mac user and you go to this URL here

970
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:17,921
or you're a Windows user and you go to this URL here,

971
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:19,281
or if you're a Linux user,

972
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,631
you probably know all of this already,

973
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:22,202
so there's no URL for you there.

974
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:25,732
You can install some of those same tools on your Mac and PC and

975
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:29,482
feel all the more at home doing things in a command line as well.

976
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:30,041
Um,

977
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:30,442
Git,

978
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,982
this is something that we actually in CS 50 abstract on top of.

979
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,011
This is essentially the de facto standard

980
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:37,761
nowadays for collaborating with other people.

981
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:40,338
Using a central cloud server in order to share

982
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:42,848
your code with it and in turn other people

983
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:44,979
for versioning your code so that you keep track

984
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:48,328
of multiple versions thereof and changes that you've made.

985
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,338
Go to this URL here if you would like,

986
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:51,899
and you'll see a tutorial by CS 50's

987
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,859
own Brian Yu introducing you to actual Git because

988
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:58,168
we've been sort of abstracting away this particular tool

989
00:33:58,168 --> 00:33:59,838
by just doing it all automatically for you.

990
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:03,298
If you've ever gone through your timeline in CS50.dev being

991
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:05,359
able to roll back to previous versions of your code,

992
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,409
we're just using Git,

993
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:06,818
but we're.

994
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:08,656
Automatically running this command for you.

995
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,456
If you want to collaborate with partners for your final project,

996
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,625
you can use Git.

997
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:13,016
However,

998
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:17,976
I will encourage you to alternatively use Visual Studio Code's live share feature,

999
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:20,335
which allows one of you to log into your code space,

1000
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,344
click some buttons,

1001
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:24,304
and then share access to your code space with your friend

1002
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:26,775
or your partner with whom you're working on the project,

1003
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:28,105
and you can both in real time,

1004
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,054
like Google Docs,

1005
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:33,105
edit the code or different files they're in using that one code space,

1006
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:35,784
a little easier than getting onboarded at least with.

1007
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:38,353
hosting a website if this proves of interest for

1008
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:40,072
your final project or even after the course,

1009
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:41,462
if it's a static website,

1010
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:43,302
two popular places to go,

1011
00:34:43,552 --> 00:34:45,302
if only because they offer free tiers,

1012
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:46,812
is what's called GitHub pages,

1013
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,632
which you can use to just host HTML,

1014
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,882
CSS and JavaScript with no Python,

1015
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:51,362
no flask,

1016
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,103
no back end,

1017
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:55,382
or NetLFy is a popular company nowadays too that has an

1018
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:57,742
entry level account for which you can sign up for free.

1019
00:34:57,873 --> 00:35:00,113
If you just want to have like a portfolio website,

1020
00:35:00,153 --> 00:35:01,952
if you're an artist or a programmer or you just want

1021
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:04,302
to have static content that you write once and deploy,

1022
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:04,712
these.

1023
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,000
Good starting points,

1024
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,060
but not all of them.

1025
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,080
Hosting a web app,

1026
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:08,600
so this,

1027
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,520
this list gets even longer,

1028
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,600
and all of these recommendations are essentially curated by the teaching staff,

1029
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,879
so they're all opinionated,

1030
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,629
but these are perhaps the most common places you can go.

1031
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:19,719
Amazon,

1032
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,510
Microsoft,

1033
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:20,989
Google,

1034
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,709
Cloudflare,

1035
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,500
they all have student type accounts.

1036
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
So if you use your .edu email address,

1037
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:25,989
for instance,

1038
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,850
or some other form of proving your status as a current student,

1039
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,399
you can generally sign up for discounts and free access

1040
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,719
to a lot of these same services as well without.

1041
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:36,277
Having to pay while you're just learning along the way.

1042
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:39,717
GitHub has something similar called the Student Developer Pack,

1043
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,406
and then a couple of other companies for hosting

1044
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,247
web apps that have been popular are Hiroku,

1045
00:35:43,326 --> 00:35:43,806
Versal,

1046
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:45,297
and bunches of others.

1047
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:48,447
So by web app we mean not just HTML CSS and JavaScript,

1048
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,007
but maybe some Python,

1049
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:52,007
maybe some JavaScript on the server,

1050
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,056
maybe Ruby,

1051
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:55,886
yet another language or any number of others when you actually

1052
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:57,977
need a back end in addition to the front end,

1053
00:35:58,126 --> 00:35:59,717
maybe you need a database as well.

1054
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,576
This would be the place to start,

1055
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:02,646
whether it's at the CS 50 hack.

1056
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,083
or beyond,

1057
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:06,724
and nowadays this is a slide that didn't even need to exist

1058
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:09,654
a couple of years ago asking AI again for your final projects,

1059
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:14,174
you are welcome and encouraged to amplifying your own productivity with AI,

1060
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:15,604
not by having it do it for you,

1061
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:17,013
but moving away from the duck,

1062
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:20,283
which by design has been fairly limited and meant to be a good teacher,

1063
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:22,733
but not necessarily one that's going to be a good

1064
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:25,003
partner when it comes to building your final project.

1065
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:26,053
So Chachi BT,

1066
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:26,374
Claw,

1067
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:26,894
Gemini,

1068
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:28,174
GitHub copilot,

1069
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,134
OpenAI Codex,

1070
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:29,773
vro,

1071
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:30,283
um,

1072
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:30,954
are all,

1073
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:31,614
uh.

1074
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,500
Popular tools right now that you might want to play around with.

1075
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:37,490
The easiest of these to use perhaps,

1076
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,811
if not familiar with say Chacha BT already,

1077
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:44,260
would be GitHub co-pilot only because you can enable it within your CS50 code

1078
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,581
space by following our own documentation at

1079
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,740
cs50.readThe docs.o where we'll tell you the sequence

1080
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,381
of steps via which you can re-enable AI now that you're allowed to for your

1081
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:57,730
final project and turn on all of those features that were disabled by default.

1082
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,031
Um,

1083
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,371
and then there's still humans out there,

1084
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,581
like what remains to be seen just.

1085
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,617
Popular these websites are in the years to come,

1086
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,577
for better or for worse,

1087
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,107
but among the places that programmers and

1088
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,587
technophiles have gone for years are Reddit,

1089
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:09,427
Stack Overflow,

1090
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:10,187
Server fault,

1091
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:12,587
where there's a rich history of questions and answers that

1092
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:15,298
ironically all of those AIs have been trained on,

1093
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:18,268
which unfortunately means some of these might be driven out of business

1094
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:20,907
eventually in some sense if we're all just turning only to AI.

1095
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:22,827
But when you actually want that human component,

1096
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,417
these are still good places to go.

1097
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:25,387
And then news,

1098
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:28,738
two of the many places you can go for news and technology,

1099
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:29,268
computing,

1100
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:29,587
computer.

1101
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:32,274
Science more broadly would be TechCrunch is still a good one.

1102
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:32,955
Hacker news,

1103
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:33,665
so to speak,

1104
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,945
and then you might have some of your own popular choices as well.

1105
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:37,334
Um,

1106
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:37,925
and then if,

1107
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:38,104
uh,

1108
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:38,955
with some bias,

1109
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:39,235
um,

1110
00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:43,225
take other classes like CS 50 besides this undergraduate class has a rich

1111
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:46,514
history now over the past decade of creating all the more open courseware,

1112
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:47,854
so courses in more Python,

1113
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:48,514
more SQL,

1114
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:49,514
a language called R,

1115
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:50,504
cybersecurity,

1116
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:50,915
uh,

1117
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:51,715
game development,

1118
00:37:51,754 --> 00:37:52,264
and more.

1119
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:56,155
All of those are linked at this URL here edX.org.cs50

1120
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:58,445
where you need not pay or sign up beyond.

1121
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,231
the course and all of the content is freely available,

1122
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,201
something for winter break,

1123
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:02,681
for instance,

1124
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,241
if you want to dive a little more deeply into

1125
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,162
some subject for the sake of your final project,

1126
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:07,521
your professional aspirations,

1127
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:10,271
or even just prepare for spring term.

1128
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,162
And then over the coming weeks too,

1129
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:15,162
will CS50 itself be soliciting interest and applications

1130
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,961
for becoming a teaching fellow or TF,

1131
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:17,761
a course assistant,

1132
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:18,392
or CA?

1133
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:22,531
If you would like to get all the more involved as a teacher of CS 50 next fall,

1134
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:22,961
uh,

1135
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:23,552
do,

1136
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,092
uh,

1137
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:27,521
follow the application link that we will soon circulate via email.

1138
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:30,769
And do stay in touch too if you just enjoy answering other

1139
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,678
people's questions or seeing what the pulse of sort of computing is,

1140
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:40,168
at this URL here is a whole bunch of CS 50's own communities in social media largely

1141
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:44,079
via which you can follow along at home in the months and years to come too.

1142
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,648
So a few thanks before we do one final game altogether to

1143
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:50,009
all of the people who have been making this course possible.

1144
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,678
So our friends at Memorial Hall who make bringing us into

1145
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,799
this beautiful space and make it possible for us to have,

1146
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:55,208
of all things,

1147
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:56,489
a class in such a.

1148
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:56,936
Space,

1149
00:38:57,176 --> 00:38:57,295
um,

1150
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,686
our friends at ESS who help with the audio each and every week in CS 50,

1151
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:00,956
um,

1152
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:02,525
the restaurant Changzhou down the road.

1153
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:04,135
We hope you'll continue to visit our friends there.

1154
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:06,325
Wesley Chen is a good friend of ours and the manager.

1155
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:06,605
Um,

1156
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,726
please tell him you're from CS 50 and I'm sure he'll be delighted to see you.

1157
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:10,016
Um,

1158
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,216
and then CS 50's own team,

1159
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:11,355
well,

1160
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,256
most of whom were in back there are sitting next to you with cameras,

1161
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:14,365
um,

1162
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,966
without whom the course wouldn't be possible.

1163
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:18,716
And of course CS 50's own teaching fellows in CAs,

1164
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:20,565
just a few of whom posed here for this photo.

1165
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:23,375
If I could invite you to all give everyone here a round of applause,

1166
00:39:23,456 --> 00:39:24,206
my thanks

1167
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:25,406
to all of them.

1168
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:30,530
So,

1169
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,479
um,

1170
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,090
and then of course,

1171
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:34,439
the CS 50 duck should be thanked as well.

1172
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:35,770
OK.

1173
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,030
Thanks to CSFT's own Rong Xin Lu and some

1174
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,669
of our own former teaching fellows and students who have

1175
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:45,550
been behind the development of that their duck that

1176
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,310
you've gotten to know over these past several months.

1177
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:48,709
All right,

1178
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,310
if Kelly could join me again on screen,

1179
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:53,360
the only thing between us and Cake is a final game,

1180
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,260
namely a quiz show in which all of you can partake.

1181
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,260
Here we go.

1182
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,260
Question one.

1183
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,979
What is the largest number in 8 bit unsigned binary digit can represent?

1184
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,989
256,

1185
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,629
128,

1186
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,479
255,

1187
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,260
or 1?

1188
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,879
Starting strong and keep in mind all of these questions came from you all,

1189
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:13,570
because we asked you recently for review questions that are now

1190
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:14,909
on the screen.

1191
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:17,489
Again,

1192
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:22,989
the timer is clicking and most popular answer was 255,

1193
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,459
which I think if we click once more,

1194
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,340
we'll confirm

1195
00:40:25,669 --> 00:40:26,659
was in fact

1196
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:28,030
the correct answer.

1197
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,500
So,

1198
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:30,489
why is that and why is it not 256?

1199
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:30,620
Well,

1200
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,080
if we start counting from zero,

1201
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:33,270
as we always have.

1202
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:36,675
That's consuming one of the 256 possibilities,

1203
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:40,594
so the largest number that we can represent with that's 8 bit and unsigned,

1204
00:40:40,635 --> 00:40:42,264
which means no negative numbers involved,

1205
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,125
is indeed going to be 255.

1206
00:40:45,274 --> 00:40:45,635
Treasure,

1207
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,905
that information now

1208
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:47,905
always.

1209
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:48,435
All right,

1210
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:49,905
next question from Kelly.

1211
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:54,274
Which issue is at the center of the year 2038 problem,

1212
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,905
which hopefully you added to your Google calendars a few weeks back,

1213
00:40:57,195 --> 00:40:58,034
entered your overflow,

1214
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:58,875
malicious inputs,

1215
00:40:59,034 --> 00:41:00,354
SQL injection attacks,

1216
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:01,485
or memory leak?

1217
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:07,760
Which of those is at the core of the year 2038 problem?

1218
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:10,189
All

1219
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:11,360
right,

1220
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,679
let's go ahead and

1221
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:14,889
reveal

1222
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:20,159
the number one answer with 92% of you saying integer overflow is in fact

1223
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:21,360
correct

1224
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:24,419
because we're still in the habit of using 32 bit

1225
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:27,050
integers to keep track of time from the so-called epoch,

1226
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,020
which was January 1st,

1227
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,439
1970,

1228
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:32,610
and unfortunately we humans aren't great at sort of planning ahead and

1229
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,010
so we're going to run out of permutations of 32 bits.

1230
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,854
By a certain date in the year 2038 unless

1231
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:42,094
everyone upgrades their computers to 64 bit counters,

1232
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:44,655
which thankfully most every piece of modern

1233
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:47,455
hardware nowadays is using already your Macs,

1234
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:48,004
your PCs,

1235
00:41:48,014 --> 00:41:48,685
and your phones.

1236
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:50,685
So hopefully this will be really a non-event,

1237
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,725
but hopefully you'll think of us in CS 50

1238
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:53,284
in,

1239
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:53,725
uh,

1240
00:41:53,774 --> 00:41:54,004
you know,

1241
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,165
10 plus years when your Google Calendar reminder goes off.

1242
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:58,375
Question three,

1243
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:00,044
which of the following is not

1244
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:01,854
a step of compiling,

1245
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:02,294
linking,

1246
00:42:02,455 --> 00:42:03,054
pre-processing,

1247
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:03,844
assembling,

1248
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:04,965
or interpreting?

1249
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,189
A bit more of a challenge,

1250
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,750
which of these is not a step of compiling.

1251
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:13,770
Alright,

1252
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,639
almost 200 responses coming in.

1253
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,030
All right,

1254
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:19,459
why don't we go ahead and reveal

1255
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:26,300
the most popular answer with 54% of you saying interpreting is in fact correct.

1256
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:27,120
Recall that we,

1257
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,669
we talked about compiling.

1258
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,389
Compiling itself is just one of several steps.

1259
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,229
There is in fact the preprocessing step which takes care

1260
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:36,469
of any of the hash symbols in C that start.

1261
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,215
With hash include hashdefine,

1262
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:38,814
and the like,

1263
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:40,094
that's preprocessing.

1264
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:43,625
There was then assembling or there was then compiling,

1265
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:47,774
which actually compiled your code into assembly code.

1266
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:49,885
There was then the assembler which would

1267
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:53,094
actually take it down further to machine code

1268
00:42:53,425 --> 00:42:54,584
and then linking.

1269
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,199
29 this is for 29% of you.

1270
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:59,959
The linking step recall was taking your zeros and ones

1271
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:03,520
and combining them with say CS 50's libraries zeros and ones

1272
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,479
and maybe the standard IO library zeros and ones linking

1273
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:09,870
them all together to give you one executable program like hell

1274
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,550
itself.

1275
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,350
All right,

1276
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,649
next question.

1277
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,610
What does a pointer store,

1278
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,840
the name of a variable,

1279
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,429
the memory addresses of a value,

1280
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,790
the size of a value,

1281
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,050
or the value of a variable?

1282
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,929
Think for a moment.

1283
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:29,169
What does a pointer store?

1284
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:32,310
Alright,

1285
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,659
about 200 responses in and yes,

1286
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,080
the memory address of a variable with 96% of you

1287
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,129
confirming as much.

1288
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:40,280
That is correct.

1289
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:42,250
Question 5.

1290
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:47,010
What is the running time of linear search?

1291
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:47,860
Bigo of 1,

1292
00:43:47,979 --> 00:43:48,530
big go of N,

1293
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,090
big go of N squared,

1294
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,489
or big O of N log N?

1295
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,239
Linear search

1296
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:55,399
running time.

1297
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,750
I recall that with something like

1298
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:02,580
search you could get lucky,

1299
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,719
but if big O is the upper bound on our running

1300
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:08,310
time you might not you might hit the end of the

1301
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,409
list that you're searching and so the running time of linear search

1302
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,310
is of course

1303
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,439
big O of.

1304
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:16,580
And

1305
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,189
it might be omega of 1,

1306
00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:19,459
but not big O of one,

1307
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:22,070
at least if we're considering what the worst case scenarios might be.

1308
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,469
All right,

1309
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,699
on to question six.

1310
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:26,310
What what data structure follows the first in,

1311
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:28,020
first out principle?

1312
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:28,750
A queue,

1313
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,520
a link list,

1314
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:30,270
a stack,

1315
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:31,580
or a hash table?

1316
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:32,830
first in,

1317
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:33,469
first out,

1318
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,260
AKA FIFO.

1319
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,570
Which of these is FIFO?

1320
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:42,159
All

1321
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:42,929
right,

1322
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:43,830
first in,

1323
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:44,689
first out

1324
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:46,260
is in fact a queue,

1325
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,899
as you would hope if you're getting in line for a restaurant,

1326
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,790
for a store,

1327
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,060
you'd hope that if you're the first one in line,

1328
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,649
you're going to be the first one out,

1329
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,750
equitably speaking,

1330
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,139
and so it is in fact a queue.

1331
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,000
The opposite of that in some sense then would have been

1332
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,860
a stack whereby when you think about the cafeteria trays,

1333
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:03,620
the sort of first one in is actually the last one out,

1334
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,810
so LIFO instead for a stack.

1335
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:06,340
All right,

1336
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,489
question 7,

1337
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,219
which operator returns the memory address of a variable?

1338
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:12,540
An asterisk,

1339
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:13,629
a dollar sign,

1340
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,780
an ampersand,

1341
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,070
or a hyphen,

1342
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,969
and a greater than sign.

1343
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,379
Presumably in C.

1344
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:25,020
Which returns the memory address.

1345
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:27,199
Of a variable

1346
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:29,800
All

1347
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,610
right,

1348
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,649
let's see what everyone thinks.

1349
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:36,879
So the most popular and correct answer is the ampersand.

1350
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:38,520
This is the address of operator.

1351
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:41,340
The asterisk recall in most contexts is the opposite of that,

1352
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,629
that's the reference operators actually go to an address,

1353
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,370
um.

1354
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:47,739
This is not a thing in C.

1355
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,709
This though is similar in spirit to a combination

1356
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,580
of the star operator and the dot operator,

1357
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,510
which means to de-reference and follow a pointer

1358
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,550
to something inside of a struct typically.

1359
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,179
All right,

1360
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,399
question 8,

1361
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,459
which SQL command is used to remove duplicate rows from a result set?

1362
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:05,649
Remove unique,

1363
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,340
distinct,

1364
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:07,389
or clean.

1365
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:14,110
We didn't spend a huge amount of time on these keywords,

1366
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,060
but

1367
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,469
only one of them applies here.

1368
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,340
A result set is just the answers that you get back when doing your select.

1369
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,439
And if you want to filter out duplicates,

1370
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,679
you can in fact say.

1371
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,929
Distinct is correct.

1372
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,770
Unique is also a keyword in SQL,

1373
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:33,320
but that is when you want to define in your schema

1374
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:37,020
that a column's values are going to be unique like an email address column.

1375
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:37,370
Instead,

1376
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,689
distinct is how you filter out duplicates in your selects.

1377
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:41,090
All right,

1378
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:42,050
question 9,

1379
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,520
we're past the halfway mark.

1380
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,399
What does an HTTP code of 418 signify?

1381
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:48,199
Not found,

1382
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,100
I'm a teapot,

1383
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:49,760
forbidden,

1384
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:51,050
unauthorized.

1385
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,719
4:18.

1386
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,399
This too,

1387
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:56,879
if you know this one moving forward,

1388
00:46:56,959 --> 00:46:58,510
you'll be considered among the

1389
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,270
CS.

1390
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:01,820
Elite

1391
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:04,919
Answers are coming in a little slower,

1392
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,590
but I'm a teapot is correct,

1393
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:09,760
which is not actually a thing or useful technology.

1394
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,879
It was in fact an April Fool's joke years

1395
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:14,199
ago where a bunch of computer scientists got together in

1396
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,679
a room and wrote out an entire specification for

1397
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:19,790
what it means for a server to return 418,

1398
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:20,800
I'm a teapot.

1399
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,510
All right,

1400
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:23,770
number 10.

1401
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,949
Where does Mao dynamically allocate memory from?

1402
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:27,919
The heap,

1403
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,280
the stack,

1404
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,560
global variables,

1405
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:31,520
or assembly?

1406
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:38,570
All

1407
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,550
right.

1408
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,040
Heap is in fact correct.

1409
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,639
That's the sort of top part of the memory,

1410
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,280
even though top and bottom make no actual technical sense.

1411
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,850
It's just our artist's rendition thereof.

1412
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,070
The stack recall is what is used when functions are being called.

1413
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,469
Every time a function is called,

1414
00:47:52,479 --> 00:47:53,959
it gets a so-called frame on the stack.

1415
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:55,969
That's where your local variables and your arguments get put.

1416
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,719
But if in C you use Mao,

1417
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:59,360
it does in fact end up on the heap.

1418
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,280
In C,

1419
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,320
if you allocate memory with Mao but forget to call free,

1420
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,399
what problem can occur a memory leak,

1421
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:06,479
segmentation fault,

1422
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:07,889
stack overflow,

1423
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,590
or all of the above?

1424
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,080
If you allocate memory with Mao,

1425
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,149
but forget to call free,

1426
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,070
what problem can occur?

1427
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:22,560
All right,

1428
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,169
most popular answer is in fact

1429
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,379
memory leak,

1430
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:27,989
which is correct.

1431
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:28,649
Um,

1432
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,060
you could imagine scenarios in which you also get

1433
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,459
a segmentation fault and or a stack overflow,

1434
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,489
but those aren't direct consequences of not calling free.

1435
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:37,419
That's generally.

1436
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:39,264
Consequence of using too much memory,

1437
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:39,955
for instance,

1438
00:48:40,165 --> 00:48:42,725
or in this case doing something wrong with your memory.

1439
00:48:42,804 --> 00:48:43,524
So interrelated,

1440
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:43,945
yes,

1441
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:46,804
but in terms of not calling free for each Mallock,

1442
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:49,155
this is what's going to happen by definition.

1443
00:48:49,405 --> 00:48:49,564
All right,

1444
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:50,675
well done there.

1445
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:51,875
Next question,

1446
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:53,354
which is 12,

1447
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:58,014
what does this domain name give the web page of

1448
00:48:58,324 --> 00:48:59,445
Safetyschool.org?

1449
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:00,645
Is it Harvard University?

1450
00:49:00,925 --> 00:49:02,195
Is it Princeton University?

1451
00:49:02,324 --> 00:49:05,485
Is it Yale University or Columbia University?

1452
00:49:10,189 --> 00:49:10,469
All right,

1453
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:14,100
recall that this was in the context of our HTTP redirections.

1454
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:14,989
Yes,

1455
00:49:15,629 --> 00:49:15,830
interesting.

1456
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,300
Yes,

1457
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:17,020
in fact,

1458
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:17,489
uh,

1459
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:18,389
Yale University,

1460
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:22,939
some alum has been paying like $10 a year for like 20 years for this joke.

1461
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:24,030
Safetyschool.org,

1462
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:24,739
if you visit it,

1463
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,709
returns an HDP 301 HDP header,

1464
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:31,209
which says the location of it is in fact yale.edu.

1465
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,030
All right,

1466
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,280
13,

1467
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:33,989
3 to go.

1468
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,780
What is the purpose of DNS?

1469
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:36,189
Uh,

1470
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,620
to encrypt data sent over the dark web.

1471
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:41,840
To find the nearest coffee shop for you,

1472
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,290
to protect your location against hackers or

1473
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,729
to translate domain names into IP addresses.

1474
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,060
What is the purpose of DNS?

1475
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:52,290
If helpful,

1476
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:53,889
domain name system.

1477
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:56,969
Alright,

1478
00:49:57,169 --> 00:49:58,169
about at the 200 mark,

1479
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:03,040
and the correct answer is indeed domain names into IP addresses.

1480
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:05,199
That is a server that is on your home network,

1481
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,330
on your ISP's network,

1482
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:07,290
on your campus's network,

1483
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,399
your corporate network that just answers questions like that for you.

1484
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:10,770
All right,

1485
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,120
second to last question,

1486
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:17,250
which of the following is not a built-in SQL feature to tackle race conditions?

1487
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:18,479
Begin transaction,

1488
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:18,979
commit,

1489
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,679
roll back,

1490
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:20,929
or enroll.

1491
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,010
We talked ever so briefly about this

1492
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,399
in the context of ending up with too much milk,

1493
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:31,219
recall.

1494
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,699
And the correct answer is.

1495
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:36,550
Indeed,

1496
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,310
enroll.

1497
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,050
All three of those,

1498
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:40,360
even though you didn't have to use them for problem sets,

1499
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,770
7 or 9

1500
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,080
are indeed,

1501
00:50:43,229 --> 00:50:43,800
uh,

1502
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,290
features of SQL,

1503
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:45,649
uh,

1504
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,399
but enroll is not a thing.

1505
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,090
All right.

1506
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:49,560
And the very last question,

1507
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,489
try to answer this as quickly as you can.

1508
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:51,594
What

1509
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:56,044
does Professor Mayland say at the beginning of every CS 50 lecture?

1510
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:58,675
Welcome to Harvard's Computer Science class.

1511
00:50:58,975 --> 00:50:59,324
Hello everyone,

1512
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:00,935
ready to code?

1513
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:02,135
All right,

1514
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:03,695
this is CS 50

1515
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:04,834
or

1516
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,294
let's get started with some programming.

1517
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:13,729
All of these questions were in fact written by you all.

1518
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,070
All right.

1519
00:51:16,149 --> 00:51:17,350
And the correct answer,

1520
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:18,699
I'm pretty sure with

1521
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,879
98% of you saying so is all right.

1522
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,469
This is CS 50 and all right,

1523
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,179
this was CS 50,

1524
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,340
cake is now served.
