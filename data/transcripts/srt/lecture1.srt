0
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,240
All

1
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,529
right,

2
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,250
this is CS 50,

3
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,599
and this is week one,

4
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:49,970
our second week together,

5
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,299
and you'll recall that last week,

6
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:51,860
week zero,

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,819
we focused on scratch ultimately this graphical

8
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,259
programming language by which you can drag and

9
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:00,220
drop puzzle pieces that interlock together only if it makes logical sense to do so.

10
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,500
And many of you had actually probably played with that

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,690
in like middle school or even prior at some point,

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,730
but for our purposes,

13
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,470
the goals of Scratch were to give us

14
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,940
sort of a mental model for some fundamental constructs

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,459
that we're going to see again and again today in C in a few weeks in Python.

16
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:14,682
and even thereafter,

17
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:18,733
and those include things like functions and return variables and

18
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:22,292
arguments and variables and loops and conditionals and more.

19
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:27,163
And so even if today feels like a bit of a fire hose such as that pictured here,

20
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:32,013
appreciate that a lot of today's ideas are exactly the same as last week's ideas.

21
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:33,852
It's just that the syntax is going to change.

22
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:34,892
It's going to look a little different.

23
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:36,053
It's going to look a little scarier.

24
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,123
It's going to be harder to sort of memorize

25
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:40,652
except with practice will come that muscle memory,

26
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,773
but the ideas ultimately are going to be the same.

27
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,005
And indeed this is,

28
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:44,956
if unfamiliar,

29
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,966
MIT down the road has a tradition of hacks whereby students

30
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:50,526
once a year do something fairly crazy and at this point

31
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:52,676
they happen to connect an actual working

32
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:56,155
uh drinking fountain to an actual fire hydrant,

33
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:56,805
and the sign there,

34
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:57,636
very pixelated,

35
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:01,926
says Getting an education from MIT is like trying to drink from a fire hose.

36
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,085
And that's indeed how computer science,

37
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:04,725
how programming,

38
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07,155
how CS 50 will sometimes feel,

39
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:12,106
but realize that what's going to be ultimately most important is not where you.

40
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:12,598
Uh,

41
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,078
feel you are day after day,

42
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:17,828
but where 3 months from now you feel that you are relative to

43
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:19,149
last week alone,

44
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,449
so-called week zero.

45
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,759
So let's look back at what week zero looked like.

46
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,078
It looked a little something like this the simplest of programs

47
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,149
by which we get get that cat to say Hello world.

48
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:29,828
Today that same code

49
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:31,748
is going to start to look a little like this,

50
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,389
which was a glimpse we gave you last week.

51
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,518
But this time I've deliberately color coded it to

52
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,548
try to send the message that we're in scratch.

53
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:41,399
We had this yellowish puzzle piece that sort of kicked things off.

54
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,192
That didn't really do anything itself,

55
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,822
but it got the program started,

56
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,061
whereas the real work was done in purple here.

57
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:48,432
Same is going to be true today,

58
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,432
whereby I'm going to wave my hands for a little

59
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:53,061
bit of time at this yellowish code on the screen,

60
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,671
but what's really going to have the most effect is

61
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:58,391
this same purple line here and the white text within.

62
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,591
And we'll break down what all of these lines mean over the next couple of weeks,

63
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:04,261
but sometimes we'll wave our hand at details if we feel

64
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,951
it's a little unnecessary at this point in the story.

65
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:07,272
And in fact,

66
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,712
let me get rid of the color coding for now and we'll see that this is the kind.

67
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:15,324
Of code in a language called C we're going to start playing with and using today

68
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,175
and for the next several weeks.

69
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:20,264
And indeed it's representative of what we're going to generally call source code.

70
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:22,225
So source code is what programmers write.

71
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,024
It's what you write.

72
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:23,824
It's what you wrote,

73
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,904
albeit by dragging and dropping puzzle pieces.

74
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,865
This week onward you're going to start using your keyboard

75
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,705
all the more and you're going to write source code.

76
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:32,304
So this is code that we humans can

77
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,895
understand with some training and with some practice,

78
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:39,904
but of course per last week what language do computers ultimately understand?

79
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,169
Only

80
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,889
so binary zeros and ones and so you and I,

81
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:45,289
yes,

82
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,729
can write code starting today in a form that looks a little something like this,

83
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,970
which admittedly might look a little arcane and cryptic,

84
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,660
but it's certainly better than a whole bunch of zeros and ones.

85
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,979
But we're going to write in source code,

86
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,740
but the machines that we write code for

87
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,240
ultimately only understand these here zeros and ones,

88
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,779
which may very well say hello world,

89
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,380
but we're going to call this moving forward machine code.

90
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,979
So machine code is what the the.

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,429
understand only the zeros and ones.

92
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,259
Source code is what you and I understand and actually write,

93
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:15,029
so it stands to reason that we're going to have

94
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:18,540
to somehow translate one to the other from source code

95
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,988
to machine code.

96
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,220
And I alluded to this ever so briefly last week,

97
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:25,149
but we're going to use the same mental model whereby the

98
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,700
source code we write might be the input to some problem.

99
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:30,929
The output we want therefrom is going to be the machine code.

100
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:32,859
So what we're going to equip you with today

101
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,269
inside of this proverbial black.

102
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,450
Box is a special piece of software that takes source code as input,

103
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:40,769
produces machine code as output,

104
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,250
and that type of program is called a compiler,

105
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,570
and there's bunches of different compilers in the world.

106
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,500
We're going to have you use one of the most popular ones,

107
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,380
but it's simply a piece of software that someone

108
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,250
else wrote that converts one language to another.

109
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,230
Source code,

110
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:53,739
for instance,

111
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,200
in a language called C to machine code,

112
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,000
the zeros and ones that our Macs PCs,

113
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:58,299
phones,

114
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,579
and other devices actually understand.

115
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,190
So where are we going to do this and how are we going to do this?

116
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,100
So I promised last week that we'd introduce you to this year tool,

117
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:09,739
which I used briefly at the very start of class to whip up that chatbot.

118
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,899
We're going to use it though not for Python this week,

119
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,660
but indeed for a different language C.

120
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,109
And indeed this tool,

121
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,709
Visual Studio Code or VS code for short,

122
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,149
is super popular in industry.

123
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,510
This is what real programmers,

124
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:20,950
so to speak,

125
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,570
are using all of the time nowadays.

126
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,989
There's absolutely alternatives.

127
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,739
If some of you have programmed before,

128
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,100
you might have used or experienced different tools,

129
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,989
but this is a very.

130
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,459
Common tool that you'll see even after CS 50,

131
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,829
and in fact it's something that ultimately you can

132
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,829
install for free on your own Macs and PCs so

133
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,489
that by the end of the course you're completely

134
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,779
independent of CS 50 and any CS50 related tools,

135
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:45,140
but what we have done for the very start of the class

136
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,940
is essentially provided you with a cloud-based version of this tool.

137
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:52,700
So all you need is a web browser on any Mac or PC or the like,

138
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,480
so that everything's pre-installed for you,

139
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,660
pre-configured for you,

140
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,190
and you don't have to deal with the stupid technical.

141
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,739
Support headaches at the start of the term because it should

142
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,670
just work.

143
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,720
But by the end of the term,

144
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,940
once you're a little more comfortable with technology and with code in particular,

145
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,510
you can absolutely offboard yourself from this tool,

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,220
install it,

147
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,260
download it on your own Mac and PC,

148
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,790
and have pretty much the exact same environment

149
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,140
completely under your control.

150
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,989
So starting today,

151
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,859
you're going to see an interface that looks quite like this quite often,

152
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,660
and we use this same interface last week ever so briefly.

153
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:22,410
Moving forward,

154
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,459
here's where we're going to write code at top right is where one or more codes.

155
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,059
Tabs are going to appear similar to any tabbed environment that you might use.

156
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:30,500
Here,

157
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:30,910
for instance,

158
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,549
is just a screenshot of the first file we'll create today called hello.c.

159
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,679
The reason it's called hello.c is because it's in a language called C,

160
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,859
as we soon shall see,

161
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,779
no pun intended.

162
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,230
Meanwhile,

163
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,630
the code here happens to be color coded,

164
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,029
not quite in the same way as you saw before,

165
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:49,760
because I manually made it look more like scratch blocks.

166
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:53,640
But among the features that VS code and other programming environments provide.

167
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,700
Something called syntax highlighting

168
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:59,230
whereby you don't worry about or even think about these colors,

169
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,660
but as you write out code in a recognized language,

170
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,750
tools like VS code will just color code different parts of

171
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,700
your code for you just to make different features jump out,

172
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,179
and we'll see what those features are

173
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,459
over the course of today.

174
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,070
But you'll also spend a good amount of time,

175
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:14,540
as I briefly did last week,

176
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,630
down here in the bottom right of your screen,

177
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,260
the so-called terminal window,

178
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,829
which is going to be where you run commands for compiling code and write.

179
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,420
In code.

180
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,869
And in fact,

181
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,940
as we'll see today,

182
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,390
you're going to start using your mouse and clicking a little bit less.

183
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,899
You're going to start using your keyboard and typing a bit more.

184
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:30,750
And ultimately,

185
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,140
even though if that first that might feel like a step

186
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,220
backwards to sort of not use something that's so user friendly,

187
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,390
the reality is most every programmer tends

188
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,989
to find themselves ultimately much more productive,

189
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:42,149
much more powerful,

190
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,299
using the keyboard more often,

191
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,420
more quickly than,

192
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:45,540
say,

193
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,059
a traditional mouse or trackpad would allow.

194
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,630
Meanwhile,

195
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,029
we'll see some somewhat familiar features.

196
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,589
Here at left like this is where you'll see the

197
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,940
files and folders that we will create over time.

198
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:56,109
At far left here is going to be an activity bar,

199
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,790
which is essentially a modern form of a menu via which

200
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,140
you can open and close things and access other features.

201
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:01,910
For my purposes,

202
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,859
I'll generally hide this part here.

203
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,850
I'll generally hide this part here so that when we're

204
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,109
together we're focusing almost entirely on code and commands,

205
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,179
but I'm just typing some quick keyboard shortcuts

206
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,779
to simplify my own user interface in that way.

207
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,750
So with all that said,

208
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:17,829
just some terminology.

209
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:21,220
So this The whole collective environment that I'm describing here

210
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,769
is generally what's known as a graphical user interface.

211
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:24,220
Why?

212
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,429
Well,

213
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,269
it's an interface for users that's graphical in

214
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,059
nature with icons and buttons and the like.

215
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,299
Shorthand notation for this is GUIY GUI for short.

216
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,580
But within this graphical user interface,

217
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,190
as promised,

218
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,190
is going to be that terminal window at bottom right where

219
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,400
I promised we would be typing most of our commands.

220
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,380
And just to give you a bit more jargon in computing,

221
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,460
that's generally known as a command line interface,

222
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,349
or CLI.

223
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,099
For short,

224
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,859
whereby you're typing commands into that interface instead,

225
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:55,789
and the world of computing software is essentially divided into GUIs and CLIs

226
00:08:55,789 --> 00:09:00,020
and sometimes a piece of software might have one of each as well.

227
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,479
But without further ado,

228
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,710
why don't we go ahead and focus entirely first on this here program,

229
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,500
which I dare say is the simplest program you can write

230
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,739
in a language like C and see how we can actually compile and run it together.

231
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,549
So I'm going to go over to VS code here.

232
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,099
I've hidden my File Explorer with all the

233
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,530
icons and I've hidden my activity bar so that

234
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,299
only do I have room for tabs of code and the command prompt at the bottom.

235
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,349
I'm calling this a command prompt because it's

236
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,380
at this dollar sign where I'm going to run

237
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,659
some of my commands,

238
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,950
and it's a dollar signed by convention.

239
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,309
It has nothing to do with currency.

240
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:33,859
It's just a computing convention.

241
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,359
Some systems will use a carrot symbol.

242
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,979
Some systems will use a greater than symbol rather,

243
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,880
or something else,

244
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,979
but it just means type your commands here.

245
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,750
The first such.

246
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,140
And I'm going to type is this

247
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,979
code hello.c with a single space in between.

248
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,859
I've not used any spaces in the name of the file.

249
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:54,489
I've not capitalized any aspect of the file just because this is convention,

250
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,739
unlike your Mac or PC,

251
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,299
where you might be in the habit of naming files with spaces and capitalization.

252
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,750
Generally you'll make your life simpler by just

253
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,000
using lowercase and no spaces at all.

254
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:05,190
As soon as I hit enter,

255
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,429
what you'll see is that a brand new tab

256
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,030
appears called hello.c with a cursor blinking on online.

257
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:15,780
I and this is essentially VS code waiting for me now to type the first line of my code.

258
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,780
Notice though that the command is complete

259
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,150
thereby whereby I have another cursor here which I'd give if

260
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,619
I click in the terminal window and give foreground to it,

261
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,510
my cursor might blink there instead.

262
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,299
That just means I can type another command when I am ready.

263
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:29,969
So let's go ahead and whip up this code,

264
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,099
and I've done this many times,

265
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,380
so I can type it fairly quickly,

266
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:36,179
but in this tab I'm going to do include standardio.h,

267
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:37,140
so to speak,

268
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:38,940
in main void.

269
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,229
Then inside of so-called curly braces indenting therein by 4 spaces,

270
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:50,469
I'm going to say print F quote unquote hello world backslash and close semicolon,

271
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,280
and voila,

272
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:53,530
I've written my first program in C.

273
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,349
In a class like this,

274
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,590
no need to write down each and every line of code that I write.

275
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,799
In fact,

276
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,469
on the course's website will be copies of everything that we've

277
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:02,270
done as well as excerpts therefrom in the course's notes,

278
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:05,159
but you're welcome but not expected to follow along

279
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,390
in real time with what I am typing here.

280
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,820
So that's it.

281
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,989
Like I've written my very first program and see if I had done

282
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:16,260
this on an actual Mac or PC without a command line interface,

283
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,070
I might have a new icon on my desktop,

284
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:18,549
so to speak,

285
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,419
called Hello,

286
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,640
and ideally I could double click on that or tap on it and run the program,

287
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,030
but because I'm in this specific programming environment that

288
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,909
has a mix of a GUI and a CLI.

289
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,622
I actually need to click down in my terminal window,

290
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,552
and I need to now compile this program first because at

291
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:36,982
this point in time it exists only as source code.

292
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:37,942
So to do this,

293
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:42,822
I'm going to compile my code by very aptly saying make space hello,

294
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,992
and I'm pronouncing the space,

295
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,543
but literally I hit the space bar.

296
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:46,663
Make space hello,

297
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,953
is it sort of implies some.

298
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:50,666
will make a program called hello.

299
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,426
Notice I have not said hello.c again because the compiler,

300
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:56,075
let's call it Make for now,

301
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:57,565
even though that's a bit of a white lie,

302
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:01,065
is going to infer that if I want to make a program called hello,

303
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:06,276
it's going to automatically look for a file called hello.c in this case,

304
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,286
so a bit of magic.

305
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:07,995
Enter.

306
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:09,580
And remarkably,

307
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,520
any time you don't see any output at a command like this,

308
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,960
that's probably a good thing.

309
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,669
Generally speaking,

310
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,960
when you see output when compiling your code,

311
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,150
you have done something wrong or in this case I might have done something wrong,

312
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,760
but no output is good because what I can now do,

313
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,309
and this is a bit cryptic,

314
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,630
I can run this program not by double clicking or tapping anywhere,

315
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,469
but by doing slash

316
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,840
hello with no spaces.

317
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,159
And this is a bit weird,

318
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:38,520
but what the slash means is that after having just made a program called hello,

319
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,690
that program's going to end up in my current folder.

320
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,650
It's somewhere in the cloud,

321
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:41,929
yes,

322
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,849
more on that in a bit,

323
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,669
but the program called hello is just somewhere in my current folder.

324
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,140
When I say slash,

325
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,619
that's like saying go into the current folder

326
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,659
and run the program therein called hello specifically.

327
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:55,169
Now,

328
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,919
as I often do,

329
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,080
I'll cross my fingers,

330
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:59,130
hope that I didn't mess this up in any way,

331
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,690
and I should see in a second.

332
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,489
Hello world indeed printed onto the screen.

333
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,900
And so just to recap those in commands,

334
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:07,409
one,

335
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:08,919
I ran code hello.c,

336
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:10,450
which is a VS code specific thing.

337
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,929
Code short for VS code,

338
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,530
just creates a new file called hello.c and then I'm on my way with my own keyboard.

339
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:20,059
Make hello compiles that source code into machine.

340
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,669
Code thereby creating a new file called hello

341
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,510
and to run that program hello,

342
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,919
I type this strange command.

343
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,109
hello.

344
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,840
But this is a paradigm no matter what you call your programs,

345
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,919
we're going to see again and again and again.

346
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,109
So even if you've not done something quite like this,

347
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,549
it will very quickly

348
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,080
get familiar.

349
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:40,669
Yes,

350
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:41,229
questions.

351
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:42,849
How,

352
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:43,900
when you say make hello,

353
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,609
how like,

354
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,299
how does,

355
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,789
how do you,

356
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,789
how does the computer know like what part of the code

357
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:51,700
to what part of the code is ascribed to hello?

358
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:52,570
Good question.

359
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:53,979
When I say make hello,

360
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,979
how does the computer know what part of the code is ascribed to this program,

361
00:13:57,099 --> 00:13:57,530
hello?

362
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:00,340
It literally is going to take the entire contents

363
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,679
of hello.c and turn them somehow into a program.

364
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:05,299
And does it have to be like hello?

365
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,630
Does it have to be named hello?

366
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:07,750
No,

367
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,109
I could have called it goodbye or anything more myfirstprogram doc,

368
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:11,969
anything at all,

369
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,140
so long as I change these words here accordingly.

370
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,299
But it has to be like it needs to be like

371
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:23,969
from the same thing like it.

372
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,159
Yes.

373
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:24,380
Exactly.

374
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,460
If you change the name there,

375
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,539
you need to change your commands accordingly.

376
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,739
Other questions on these here,

377
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:30,950
steps.

378
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:33,599
No.

379
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,200
All right,

380
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,880
so let's tease apart what it is we just did and

381
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,280
like why this code works in the way that it does.

382
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:39,559
Well,

383
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,359
to recap,

384
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,919
in Scratch,

385
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
we had a program like this.

386
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,200
When the green flag was clicked,

387
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,510
we wanted to say hello world onto the screen.

388
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,640
The code that corresponds to that is roughly here and indeed notice that

389
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,530
the yellowish or orangeish code lines up with the when green flag clicked,

390
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,760
the purple code here lines up with the same block,

391
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,000
and the white code inside of here roughly corresponds to what was in

392
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,789
the white oval that we kept using again and again last week.

393
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,760
So let's do more of a one.

394
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:04,892
One correspondence and these slides are deliberately designed

395
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:07,372
to give you again that sort of mental model

396
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:12,142
of taking same ideas from last week and just changing the syntax this week onwards.

397
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,622
So when we have a function like this thing here,

398
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:17,081
and recall that a function is just an action or verb,

399
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:19,411
it sort of accomplishes a small piece of work

400
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,932
in code in C specifically,

401
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:22,971
you're going to type,

402
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,581
of course not a purple puzzle piece,

403
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:27,651
but you're going to say the word print while more technically print F,

404
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:28,942
where the F as we'll soon see,

405
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,622
means format the printed.

406
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:34,393
Output because this is more powerful than just printing some raw text alone,

407
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:38,604
then you can have parentheses open and closed left and right and notice that it's no

408
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,484
accident that MIT MIT chose an oval for

409
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:44,833
their input to functions because it roughly looks like

410
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,434
the start of a parenthesis and parenthesis on left and right.

411
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:49,004
Meanwhile,

412
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,114
what goes inside of the parentheses in the corresponding C code,

413
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:52,283
well,

414
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:52,814
at the end of the day,

415
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,953
minimally hello,

416
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:57,254
comma world because that's literally what we want to print to the screen.

417
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,234
But in C,

418
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,403
unlike in Scratch.

419
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:00,635
A bit of overhead,

420
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:03,135
a bit of additional syntax that you just got to deal with

421
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:06,375
to make clear to the computer what you want to print.

422
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:07,455
In particular,

423
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:11,625
you're going to have to surround everything you want to print with double quotes to

424
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,745
make clear that hello is not some special function or variable or something else.

425
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:19,296
It's Hello world is the English phrase that you want to print.

426
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,385
So double quote here,

427
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:24,656
double quote there means He's the beginning and the end of what I want to print.

428
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:28,145
You're also curiously going to put a backslash n.

429
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,200
In most cases,

430
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,890
at the end of the word or words you want to print,

431
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,799
we'll take that away in a moment and see what it does

432
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:38,409
and then lastly and perhaps most annoyingly in programming circles,

433
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,669
you have to finish your thought with a semicolon,

434
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,770
much like in English you would finish most sentences with a period instead.

435
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,219
And the thing the thing about programming is with C in particular,

436
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,739
if you mess up almost any of these details I just rattled off,

437
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,159
something's going to go wrong.

438
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:54,340
And so you're in good company.

439
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:57,109
The very first program you try to write or try to compile,

440
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,270
odds are it might not work correctly because

441
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,070
you'll develop over time the muscle memory for spotting

442
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,270
all of these seemingly minor and actually minor

443
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,550
details but that do matter to the computer.

444
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:09,650
All right,

445
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,050
so if you're familiar,

446
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:11,250
of course,

447
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,800
with the notation in like mathematics of functions like a function in code,

448
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,598
it's really the same idea as a function in math whereby the function F

449
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:19,608
takes some input,

450
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:20,449
for instance X,

451
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,118
and generally produces some output.

452
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,770
So if you're coming more from that background,

453
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,680
realize that what we're really doing here is roughly the same.

454
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:27,719
But in code,

455
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,969
recall that we can have different types of output.

456
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,079
So if this is our grand mental model and say we've got a function.

457
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,869
As inside of this black box that takes arguments,

458
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,349
that is to say is it's inputs,

459
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,750
it can sometimes have side effects and recall that side

460
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,020
effects are often visual things that happen as a result.

461
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,260
They just play on the screen,

462
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,579
maybe it comes out of the speaker.

463
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,540
It's some thing generally ephemeral that just happens,

464
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:49,910
but it's.

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,390
Not necessarily useful in the same way as another type

466
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,180
of function that we'll return to in just a bit,

467
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,229
but last week recall that we got the cat with

468
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:59,430
the speech bubble to manifest on the screen and say

469
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,150
hello world in that speech bubble when the input was

470
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,469
hello world and the corresponding function was instead say.

471
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,770
So let's see if we can't now

472
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,060
tease apart

473
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,500
what the code we wrote is actually doing for us bit by bit.

474
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:18,020
So let me go back to VS code here and let me propose to break this in a little way.

475
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:19,739
Let me delete the backslash N,

476
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,469
if only because at first glance,

477
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:23,140
who knows or cares what that's doing.

478
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,209
Let's just get rid of it if we don't understand it.

479
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,140
I could now go back down to my terminal window

480
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,099
and I could do hello enter again,

481
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,380
but there's seemingly no change.

482
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:34,660
Which is good,

483
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,459
doesn't seem like I broke it,

484
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,260
but I've kind of misled you here why?

485
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,290
Why did nothing seem to change?

486
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,729
I didn't recompile it,

487
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,040
so recall that

488
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,930
the compiler converts source code to machine code,

489
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,530
but I already did that a couple of minutes ago.

490
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,849
If I've changed the source code,

491
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:55,000
it stands to reason that I need to recompile the code

492
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,640
to actually see the effects of that.

493
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,880
So let me do that again.

494
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,469
Make hello E.

495
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,719
Nothing seems to have gone wrong,

496
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,609
but let me now do hello Enter.

497
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:08,910
And it's subtle now and in fact let me go ahead and zoom in,

498
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,880
it's really just an aesthetic bug insofar as functionally

499
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,390
the program is still technically printing Hello world,

500
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,630
but what's seemingly wrong

501
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,760
or put another way,

502
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,949
what did the backslash and apparently do?

503
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:21,359
Yeah.

504
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:22,920
Yeah,

505
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,760
so it's somehow giving me a new line,

506
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,869
and that's essentially what the backslash N denotes is give me a new line there.

507
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,880
And why was I doing that?

508
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:29,959
Well,

509
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,079
really just for the aesthetics.

510
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,270
Like if this dollar sign represents my prompt where I type commands,

511
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:34,880
if anything,

512
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,630
it just looks kind of stupid that I finished a program over here

513
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,599
and then the prompt is on the same line.

514
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,880
It just looks wrong even though you could sort of argue that was my intent,

515
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,790
even though in this case it wasn't.

516
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,510
So what would the alternative be?

517
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:46,760
Well,

518
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,959
what you're seeing here is what's actually

519
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,160
generally known as an escape sequence which.

520
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:51,925
are

521
00:19:52,295 --> 00:19:54,175
sort of special sequences

522
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:59,935
of symbols like backslash and N in this case that do a little something unusual.

523
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:03,494
And here's just a non-exhaustive list of some you'll encounter in the real world

524
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,444
and including in CS 50 backslash N moves you to a new line.

525
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,935
Backslash R is a so-called carriage return if you've

526
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:12,005
ever seen or used an old school typewriter,

527
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:16,094
this refers to the process of bringing the typing head back to the left end,

528
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,814
so it sort of moves the cursor horizontally as opposed to vertically.

529
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,380
This one's interesting.

530
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,089
backslash double quote.

531
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,380
Why does there exist this pattern?

532
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,119
Backslash double quote,

533
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,729
yeah.

534
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:31,979
Exactly.

535
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:36,410
So recall that phrase we tried to type,

536
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:36,609
uh,

537
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,800
print out like hello,

538
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,540
comma world.

539
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,839
If for some reason you don't want to say hello world,

540
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,890
but you wanted to say some or like sort

541
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,790
of snarkily like hello world or something like that,

542
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:46,160
well,

543
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,609
you can't put a quote,

544
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:48,089
a quote,

545
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,390
a quote at a quote and expect the computer to know which quote corresponds to what.

546
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,959
It's just arguably ambiguous.

547
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:59,209
So if inside of double quotes you actually want to print actual double quotes.

548
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,589
This is an escape sequence that tells the computer

549
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,829
this is not some

550
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,579
quote delineating where my thought begins and ends.

551
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,640
This is literally a double quote and we'll see other situations

552
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,750
in which a single quote or apostrophe is the same.

553
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,790
We'll see crazy situations in which you want to print a backslash,

554
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,670
but backslash already has some special meaning,

555
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,760
so there's solutions to all of these problems.

556
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,869
But let's not get too far into the weeds here.

557
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,640
But let me go back to the code and propose what the alternative.

558
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:25,989
Otherwise might have been.

559
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,199
If I didn't know about backslashn,

560
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,180
my instinct to move the cursor to the next line might have

561
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,150
been literally to just like hit enter or do something like this,

562
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,400
like move the double quote,

563
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,239
move the parenthesis,

564
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,229
move the semicolon onto the next line.

565
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,439
But this should start to rub you the wrong way.

566
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:44,560
And indeed this violates a principle of most programming

567
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,119
languages and that most programming languages are line based.

568
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,880
You sort of start and finish your thought.

569
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:50,550
Ideally

570
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,060
on the same line,

571
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:53,550
and this runs afoul of that.

572
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,239
And 2,

573
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,189
even if you're seeing code for the first time,

574
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,479
assume that this just looks stupid as well to sort

575
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,599
of move part of your thought to the next line.

576
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,560
It just looks a little sloppy and it is.

577
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,560
So C and many other languages,

578
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,550
Python among them,

579
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,199
solve this by giving you these so-called escape sequences.

580
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,520
So if you want a new line there,

581
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,430
you do backslash N and you will get your new line

582
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,229
there.

583
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,880
Now that's a bit of an Overstatement what I said in that sometimes lines

584
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,969
of code will be so long that they do wrap onto multiple lines,

585
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,790
but generally

586
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,150
that's a convention that we're going to try

587
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,189
to avoid.

588
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:25,800
All right,

589
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,910
what else could go wrong?

590
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,130
Well,

591
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:27,640
let's do this.

592
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,390
Let me go ahead and clear my terminal window,

593
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,520
which I can do by hitting

594
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,069
control L,

595
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,959
or I can literally type clear and I'm going to

596
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,310
frequently do this just to keep the screen clear,

597
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,989
even though it has no functional impact.

598
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,189
It's just an aesthetic.

599
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,349
Let me do something else.

600
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,920
suppose I forgot to finish my thought and I omitted the semicolon,

601
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,469
but otherwise the code is perfect.

602
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,829
Let me do make hello now.

603
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:49,650
Enter.

604
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,199
Now we're going to see some output that's a little more arcane.

605
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,239
Let me go ahead and scroll back up here to

606
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:58,270
make clear that what's just happened is Iran make hello,

607
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,680
but I didn't get back to another prompt.

608
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,640
I don't see immediately a dollar sign because there's an error message here

609
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,040
that is almost as long as the code I tried to write.

610
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:07,010
Not to worry.

611
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:07,680
Let's see.

612
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,890
Here is the name of the file in which the problem exists,

613
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,810
stands to reason that it's in hello.c.

614
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:17,160
Here is the line number in which the problem seems to exist,

615
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:17,930
line 5,

616
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,140
and that's helpful because it lines up with this.

617
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,810
And then if you're you care to.

618
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,920
This is the 29th character.

619
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,209
So if I count from left to right around 29,

620
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:28,239
something is wrong,

621
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,130
something is missing.

622
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,040
So it's a pretty decent error message.

623
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,410
In fact,

624
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:34,760
it even says expected semicolon after expression.

625
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,410
There's a little green carrot symbol pointing me at the mistake.

626
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:41,229
So this is again this is another value of the compiler.

627
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:44,619
Not only does it know how to convert source code to machine code,

628
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,349
it's also pretty good at finding mistakes in your

629
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:50,219
code and trying to draw your attention to them.

630
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:51,380
So how do I fix this?

631
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,609
Well,

632
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,829
assuming you've understood the error message at this.

633
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:54,364
Point.

634
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:54,635
Well,

635
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,694
you just go back in,

636
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:57,005
add the semicolon,

637
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:58,714
let me go back down to my terminal window.

638
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:01,425
I'm gonna clear it just to clean up the mess.

639
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:03,084
Let me rerun make hello,

640
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,885
and now we are back in business and indeed if I do slash hello,

641
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,505
I've got hello world

642
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,084
back on the screen.

643
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:10,569
Well,

644
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:11,969
let's make one other mistake.

645
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,689
Suppose that I forgot,

646
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,010
as you sometimes will,

647
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,819
to include this line at the top,

648
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,180
which will make more sense next week.

649
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,650
But for now,

650
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,569
let's just omit it and dive right into the code.

651
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,930
You would think this is enough,

652
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,969
just printing out Hello world.

653
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,229
Well,

654
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:24,660
here,

655
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:26,449
let me go back down to my terminal window.

656
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,329
Let me do make hello again now,

657
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,380
and I'm going to get a whole different error message instead.

658
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,670
So now

659
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,420
the problem is still with hello.c.

660
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,329
that makes sense.

661
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:36,939
Line 3,

662
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,500
OK,

663
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:40,900
so somewhere in there print F is suddenly the problem even

664
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,540
though the semicolon is back and the backslash N is back.

665
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:49,260
So let's keep reading error call to undeclared library function print F with type.

666
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,594
And and then this is a whole mouthful.

667
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:54,545
So here is an example of an error message that unless you're sort

668
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:57,734
of conditioned to know what this means and you've seen it before,

669
00:24:57,944 --> 00:25:01,625
it's quite more cryptic and unclear like what the solution to the problem is,

670
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:05,015
especially when the rest of your code is truly correct.

671
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:06,844
I've just forgotten something stupid,

672
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:08,055
but how can I

673
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:09,704
sort of think about this problem?

674
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:09,864
Well,

675
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:10,744
it turns out.

676
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,770
That another feature

677
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:16,130
of C is that it comes with a bunch of header files,

678
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:20,949
a bunch of files whose names don't end in doc but end in H,

679
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,890
and these so-called header files,

680
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,829
which end inh contain

681
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:31,000
code that other people wrote that you can use in your own programs.

682
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,229
So for instance,

683
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,410
in this particular case,

684
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,099
a header file is giving us access to what's more generally.

685
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:38,219
In computing called a library,

686
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,530
a library is code someone else wrote that you can use,

687
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,579
and I actually used the library last week when

688
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,130
I did that import line and mentioned OpenAI,

689
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:46,890
the company,

690
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,209
I was actually using a library from that company

691
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,900
that I automatically downloaded and installed into my programming

692
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
environment in advance of class because I don't know how

693
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,859
to implement a chatbot without standing on their shoulders and

694
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:01,140
using a lot of the code they themselves wrote.

695
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,729
Same idea here,

696
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,689
even though printF is a feature of C,

697
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,170
if you want to use it,

698
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,250
you have to include that library by telling your program to include

699
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:13,739
the header file.

700
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:17,560
That defines that function and you only know this by being taught

701
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,439
it or looking it up in a book or a reference,

702
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:26,449
but in this case I wanted to use a header file called Stanio.h STDio.h.

703
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:29,489
It is not studio.h.

704
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,010
This is a very common

705
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,609
bug online if you find yourself typing studio.

706
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:35,709
Hypo,

707
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:42,060
it's standardio.h and in that file then is defined the printer function.

708
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,920
So if I go back to my code here,

709
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,819
the solution to this problem truly is to just undo the deletion I made a moment

710
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,420
ago because what line one is now doing for me is it's telling the compiler,

711
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:52,329
oh by the way,

712
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,930
I didn't write all of the code that I'm about to use.

713
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:58,810
Please include the definition of printF

714
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,339
from this other file called standardio.h.

715
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,650
And again,

716
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,520
you'd only know this by looking it up in a reference,

717
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,369
attending a lecture or something like that.

718
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:06,979
It's not obvious otherwise,

719
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,099
but these are the kinds of things you very quickly look up.

720
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:11,760
So where do you look them up?

721
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:11,930
Well,

722
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,849
it turns out the ecosystem of C.

723
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,260
Has hundreds of books you can buy or download.

724
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,510
Many,

725
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:17,839
many,

726
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,500
many websites among them is one of CS 50's own.

727
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,449
And in fact the conventional way

728
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,500
to look stuff up for the programming language called C is to

729
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,250
look at the official manual pages or man pages for sure,

730
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:31,199
for the C language.

731
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,020
Unfortunately,

732
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,380
many of them were written decades ago when they were certainly

733
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,579
written by fairly advanced programmers and not for a broad audience.

734
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,140
And so what we have done is imported all of that freely available documentation.

735
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:42,880
Uh,

736
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,810
hosted it at our own URL here,

737
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,459
manual.cs50.O,

738
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,260
and we've essentially simplified it for those less comfortable,

739
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,180
those of you who might be less familiar with,

740
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,609
less comfortable with technology,

741
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,849
and really for most people who aren't used to reading manual pages,

742
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:00,050
it's just useful to have it written in teaching assistant-like language instead.

743
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,939
So for For instance,

744
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,349
if you go to a URL like this,

745
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,589
you'll see CS 50's documentation for this official

746
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:09,500
library Standardio.h that comes with C itself.

747
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:10,670
If you get a URL like this,

748
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:14,180
you can look up the documentation for printF itself specifically.

749
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:14,989
So for instance,

750
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,219
let me go ahead and just give you a teaser for this.

751
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,709
If I were to do the same.

752
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,300
On my own computer,

753
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:23,630
I might see the CS 50 manual pages here and you'll see header

754
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,280
file by header file a bunch of frequently used functions in CS 50.

755
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,560
We've also filtered the list down from a massive list to a much shorter

756
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,040
list so that you can sort of see what's most likely useful to you.

757
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,859
If you go to a specific page like Standardio.H,

758
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,270
you'll see for instance here just over a half dozen

759
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,930
functions that we won't touch on today beyond print def,

760
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,319
but that we'll see in the class over time that does useful stuff for.

761
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:48,735
For instance print prints to the screen and

762
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,696
we'll see other functions for opening files,

763
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:51,566
closing files,

764
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:56,206
and the like because all of that's related to standard IO input and output.

765
00:28:56,336 --> 00:29:00,995
If I go to a specific man page for this header file,

766
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:03,615
you'll see the standard formatting for these pages.

767
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,255
So here's the name of the function printF,

768
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,526
and it prints to the screen.

769
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:07,776
You'll see a synopsis,

770
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:10,095
and this indeed indicates we're in less comfortable mode.

771
00:29:10,176 --> 00:29:11,365
If you want to see the original,

772
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:12,806
more arcane documentation,

773
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:13,696
just uncheck that.

774
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:16,381
And you'll see the original official documentation,

775
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:19,312
but you'll see a mention of like what header file this function is defined

776
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,982
in so that you know what file to use in your own code.

777
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:23,661
You'll see a so-called prototype,

778
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:24,541
which is just

779
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,462
the first line of code from that function.

780
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:28,802
More on that in just a little bit.

781
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:30,192
You'll see an English description.

782
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:31,151
You'll see example code.

783
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:32,062
Long story short,

784
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:34,442
this is the authoritative answer.

785
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,541
And even though you have access in this class,

786
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:41,182
to the virtual rubber duck at CS50.AI and other forms of it that you'll soon see.

787
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,109
You should also have the tendency and the

788
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:47,630
instinct moving forward to check the official documentation,

789
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:52,069
and all of today's AIs are trained on things like the official documentation.

790
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,719
So that's the source material

791
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:54,959
that any of these AI,

792
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,829
the ducks the duck among them are actually relying on.

793
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:02,500
But what we're also going to see is that besides these official functions,

794
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,050
there's some that CS 50 itself has invented.

795
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:08,060
We use these really as training wheels for just the first few weeks of the course,

796
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,930
and then we take these training wheels off,

797
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,160
but the reality is in a language like C,

798
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:15,390
certain stuff is just really hard or annoying to do.

799
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,969
Certainly if you're learning how to program for the very first time,

800
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:19,650
or at least you are new to C,

801
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,750
we'll eventually show you how to do it that way.

802
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,900
But even if you just want to get input from the

803
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,060
user like a string of text or a number of some.

804
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:29,655
It's generally not that easy to do and see,

805
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:31,094
at least in these early days.

806
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:31,744
So for instance,

807
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:34,305
at this URL here you can see documentation for CS

808
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:38,265
50's own library and CS 50's own header file CS50.H,

809
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:42,064
and you'll see such functions in the documentation as these get string,

810
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:42,864
get in,

811
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:43,694
get char,

812
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,025
and a bunch of others as well,

813
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:46,935
and we'll touch on those this week,

814
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:51,305
but it will ultimately be a way of just getting useful

815
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:54,944
work done quickly by standing on our shoulders and actually.

816
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:55,750
Uh,

817
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,369
using functions we wrote

818
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,910
to then solve problems of interest

819
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,939
to you.

820
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,849
So let's focus,

821
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,449
for instance,

822
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,650
on one of these first.

823
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:04,650
Get string.

824
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,689
A string in programming speak means text,

825
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:11,099
zero or more characters of text like H E L

826
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,380
L O W O R L D.

827
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:18,219
That is a string of text in computer speak and it's obviously not a number like 50,

828
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,290
it's actual text that you would type on the keyboard.

829
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,369
We'll see then what other things we want to get,

830
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,060
but with this.

831
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:24,175
this function,

832
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:26,704
we can start to replicate another program that

833
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:29,494
we implemented pretty quickly last week in Scratch.

834
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:32,295
So recall that in Scratch this one was a little more interactive.

835
00:31:32,464 --> 00:31:35,265
I used another blue puzzle piece ask to actually

836
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:38,594
get input from the user and recall that unlike

837
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:43,255
the printF function today and the same block last week,

838
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:46,334
this time we still have the same input output model,

839
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:48,994
but if we pass an arguments to a function

840
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,785
that we're about to see.

841
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,390
You can get back not just a side effect sometimes but a

842
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,219
return value like a useful reusable value like the person's name,

843
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,459
as we'll soon see.

844
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:00,790
All right,

845
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:01,989
so let's actually do this.

846
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:05,540
If in scratch the equivalent was asking the user what's your name,

847
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,459
asking them that,

848
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:09,260
and then waiting for an answer that we can store in a variable,

849
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,349
let me propose that in C side by side it's going to look a little something like this.

850
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:14,115
Instead,

851
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:15,956
at left we have the scratch block,

852
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:17,196
the ask function.

853
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:19,005
Here is the argument there too,

854
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:22,316
and then it and wait just means it's going to wait till the user finishes typing.

855
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:26,206
If I want to translate this to see now today moving forward,

856
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:26,605
well,

857
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,235
it looks a little something like this.

858
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:30,576
The closest analog in C,

859
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:34,656
thanks to CS 50's library is going to be a function called get string.

860
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:35,895
So there's no C function called.

861
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:40,011
Ask and we deliberately named this function get string just to make super clear

862
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:42,972
what it is you are getting a string of text in this case,

863
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:44,932
and we've got the parentheses ready to go

864
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:47,852
indicative of this white oval for user input.

865
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:50,732
If I want to prompt the user with that same phrase,

866
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:51,771
what's your name?

867
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:51,982
Well,

868
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:54,972
I can just put it inside of those parentheses.

869
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,832
But what next do I need to add

870
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,302
around my user input?

871
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,160
Yeah,

872
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,589
I need the quotation marks just to make clear

873
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,089
that these aren't special individual words.

874
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,670
This is a whole phrase that I want to be displayed to the user,

875
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,709
so I'm going to indeed put double quotes around everything,

876
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,069
and this is just an aesthetic.

877
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,400
I don't in this case want to bother moving the cursor to the next line.

878
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:20,015
Like I want the user to see the question

879
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,224
and I want the cursor to just stay there blinking,

880
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:23,454
waiting for their prompt,

881
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,994
but I don't want the cursor to be right next to the question mark.

882
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:29,305
So I'm deliberately just leaving a single white space there just to kind

883
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,574
of scooch it over a bit so it looks a little prettier,

884
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:32,775
at least to my eye.

885
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:33,905
Now we're not done yet.

886
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,130
Because we need to do something with this value.

887
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,170
The get string function,

888
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:38,890
as we'll soon see,

889
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,839
is going to prompt the user for me to type something in like my name,

890
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,569
but where do I want to put that?

891
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:43,770
Well,

892
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,729
MIT has the answer put in a variable called answer,

893
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,239
and you can't rename that in scratch.

894
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,599
It's just defined as answer.

895
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,319
But

896
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,239
in C,

897
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,800
what I'm going to need to do is something like this.

898
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,160
If you want to keep return values around from a function,

899
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:02,130
you literally use an equal sign.

900
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:08,050
And then to the left of it you put the name of the variable into which you want to put

901
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,550
that return value.

902
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,188
So in mathematics we would use X,

903
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,300
Y,

904
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,399
and Z as our variables.

905
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,330
Again in code,

906
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,260
as in scratch,

907
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,379
you can name your variables anything you want.

908
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,300
By convention they should usually be lowercase.

909
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:19,938
They should not have spaces therein,

910
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,219
similar to file names,

911
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:24,620
but this is a pretty good analog now of what's going on collectively.

912
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:25,495
Here,

913
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:27,254
but C is a little more

914
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:28,614
precise.

915
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:31,094
You can't just give the variable a name.

916
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:35,014
You need to tell C or really the compiler,

917
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:38,665
what type of value you want to put in this variable.

918
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:39,853
So if it's a string of text,

919
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,054
you put string.

920
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:41,813
If it's a number,

921
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:42,813
you're going to put something else.

922
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:44,135
But for now it's a string

923
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:46,594
per the function's name it's going to give me

924
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,014
a string.

925
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:50,264
Now we're so close to finishing this comparison.

926
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:51,824
There's one detail missing.

927
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,478
What's still missing from the code here?

928
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:55,398
Yeah,

929
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:57,178
yeah,

930
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:00,448
so we have to finish the thought lastly with a semicolon.

931
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,118
So if you're getting the sort of the point already,

932
00:35:02,178 --> 00:35:04,178
like this is one of the reasons why we start with scratch,

933
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:06,739
you sort of you get the intuition pretty quickly and even

934
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,658
though nothing on the right hand side is particularly hard,

935
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,339
there's just all these stupid little details that

936
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,099
you have to ingrain in yourself over time.

937
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:13,070
In this case,

938
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,550
for C,

939
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:16,780
but for many programming languages we're going to see the similar paradigm.

940
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,629
But among the goals of the course too are

941
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:21,030
to show you how ultimately languages have been evolving.

942
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,669
And so one of the things we'll see in Python in a few weeks' time

943
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,229
that some of this syntax actually goes away because over time humans.

944
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:30,145
Gotten annoyed at older languages like this.

945
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,145
Like why the heck do I have to keep putting a semicolon

946
00:35:32,145 --> 00:35:33,895
when it's clear that I'm at the end of the line?

947
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:36,784
So we'll see among languages like Python we can

948
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,895
get rid of some of these same features.

949
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,455
But for now it's just a matter of remembering what goes where.

950
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:42,905
All right,

951
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,064
so let's go ahead now.

952
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,870
And take that same idea

953
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,639
of converting Scratch to see and actually do something with this code.

954
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,270
Let me go back to VS code here.

955
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,770
I'm going to keep my file name the same,

956
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,439
but what you'll see on CS50's website is that we'll add version numbers to each of

957
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,479
the examples that I'm typing out so you

958
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:00,860
can actually see the progression of these programs,

959
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,469
even though we're not changing the name.

960
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,159
And what I'm going to go ahead and do here,

961
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:04,850
for instance,

962
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:07,600
in hello.c this time.

963
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,189
Is the following.

964
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,879
I'm going to go ahead and

965
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,909
first get rid of the single Hello world.

966
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,449
I'm going to go up here and include this time CS 50.

967
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:17,870
H,

968
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,750
so not one but two header files,

969
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:23,879
and then inside of my curly braces inside the so-called main function,

970
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:24,989
as we'll soon call it,

971
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,719
I'm going to go ahead and do this

972
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,760
exactly the same line of code as on the screen before.

973
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm going to get a string.

974
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,219
Prompting the user for what's your name?

975
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:37,159
question mark space close semicolon,

976
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,320
and as an aside,

977
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,060
this will will soon see print on the screen.

978
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,199
What's your name?

979
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,479
So that implies that the get string function is actually using printF itself

980
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,010
to print out that message.

981
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,729
I do not need to use printF to display that message on the screen because I read the

982
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,129
documentation for CS 50's get string function and I

983
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:58,489
just know that it is using printF for me

984
00:36:58,729 --> 00:36:59,729
to achieve that particular goal.

985
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:03,655
Now let me do something intuitive but not quite correct.

986
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:06,705
If I want to print out that answer so that the expression is

987
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:09,895
going to be not hello world but hello David or hello Kelly,

988
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:11,745
let me go ahead and say hello answer

989
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:16,294
backslash and to move the cursor down as before,

990
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:17,264
semicolon.

991
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,100
So this is not quite right,

992
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,540
and even if you've never programmed before,

993
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,409
you can perhaps see where this is erroneously going.

994
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,860
Let me remake the program because I've changed the

995
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,689
source code and I need new machine code.

996
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:32,689
Nothing seems to be wrong aesthetic logic rather syntactically,

997
00:37:32,939 --> 00:37:35,760
but if I do now hello and hit enter,

998
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,250
you'll see I'm being prompt.

999
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:37,889
What's your name?

1000
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,530
So I'm going to go ahead and type in David and then hit enter.

1001
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,860
But when I do,

1002
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,540
If you know where this is going,

1003
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,810
what am I going to see instead?

1004
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:49,949
Hello answer and the computer's just doing literally what I told it to do.

1005
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,340
I said,

1006
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:50,830
quote unquote,

1007
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:51,959
print out hello answer,

1008
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,260
but obviously that's not the goal that I have in mind.

1009
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:57,070
So how do I actually work around that?

1010
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:57,239
Well,

1011
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:01,060
what I really need to do is achieve the equivalent of this thing here,

1012
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:04,560
which we did by stacking blocks in scratch or nesting them,

1013
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:05,199
if you will,

1014
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,379
one inside of the other.

1015
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,469
So I want to join the expression hello,

1016
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,860
comma space and that answer,

1017
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:13,399
and it turns out in C you can't do it quite like this.

1018
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:14,790
Like there isn't an analog of the.

1019
00:38:15,257 --> 00:38:17,197
function at least that we'll see today.

1020
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:19,826
So we have to do this a little bit differently.

1021
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:21,287
We can do it though

1022
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,076
by maybe telling the computer,

1023
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:26,406
well go ahead and print out hello com space and then

1024
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:29,406
maybe we can give it like a placeholder to plug in the

1025
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:32,287
name once we know the name because when I'm writing my

1026
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:34,287
code I have no idea who's going to play this game,

1027
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:35,836
me or Kelly or someone else.

1028
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:39,156
So what if we use special syntax to indicate

1029
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:42,076
where I want the person's name actually to go?

1030
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:43,646
Let me propose that we now do this.

1031
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:45,454
Instead of

1032
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,533
printing out hello

1033
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:49,823
hello answer,

1034
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:50,894
quote unquote,

1035
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:53,013
let's go ahead and start printing out something,

1036
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:56,533
and I got my parentheses ready to go and I did my semicolon in advance this time.

1037
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:59,974
I want to somehow now say hello comma placeholder,

1038
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:02,184
and you would only know this by someone having told you

1039
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:06,374
or a reference online percent S is the placeholder for a string

1040
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,854
that you don't know when you're writing the code,

1041
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,013
but when someone else is running the code,

1042
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:12,503
it will be filled in.

1043
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,470
And substituted for their input.

1044
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,871
So hello cents is the closest we can get to this.

1045
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,801
I still need those some other syntax.

1046
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:20,281
I still,

1047
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:23,841
I do need those quotes on the left and the right

1048
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,470
just to be aesthetically pleasing.

1049
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,510
I'm going to put a backslash N there at the end to move the cursor,

1050
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,351
but now I've left room in my parenthesis for one more thing,

1051
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:34,281
and you could perhaps guess where I'm going with this again,

1052
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:35,910
even if you've never programmed before,

1053
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,480
this is telling print F print out H E L L O comma space something.

1054
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,659
What should I probably pass in

1055
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:49,379
to these parentheses as a second input so that PRF knows what that something is.

1056
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:51,010
Yeah.

1057
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:53,169
The variable name,

1058
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,790
so the variable in which I have the user's name,

1059
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,600
and indeed the convention is to put a comma after the quotes and then the name

1060
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,110
of the variable that has the value you want to be substituted for that placeholder.

1061
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,350
Now notice there's a collision of syntax and grammar here.

1062
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,479
The comma inside of the quotes is just an English thing.

1063
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:12,879
Hello.

1064
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:14,625
so and so.

1065
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:19,475
The comma outside of the quotes is meaningful to see because it delineates which

1066
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:24,064
is the first input or argument to left and which now is the second,

1067
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:27,504
and we haven't seen this before in C up until now we've only been passing one input,

1068
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:29,425
but you can pass in 2 or 3 or 4.

1069
00:40:29,665 --> 00:40:32,155
Completely depends on what the function is designed

1070
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:33,635
to expect.

1071
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,709
So let me put this all together now.

1072
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,969
Let me go back to VS code.

1073
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,550
Previously we were literally printing out answer,

1074
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,139
but I can change answer to percent S.

1075
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,679
I can move my cursor outside of those quotes,

1076
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,989
comma answer,

1077
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,320
because that's the name I gave to that variable.

1078
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,830
I can go back down to my terminal window and clear it

1079
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,110
just to reduce clutter.

1080
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,219
Let me do make hello one more time.

1081
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,189
Seems to work.

1082
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,310
hello,

1083
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,510
E DAVID,

1084
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,350
and now

1085
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,800
hello David is printed.

1086
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:04,750
OK,

1087
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,879
questions on any and all of that.

1088
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:11,899
Mhm.

1089
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,060
Good question.

1090
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,820
Where is it pulling these header files from?

1091
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,659
So what you are seeing here is a graphical user

1092
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:21,899
interface that's somewhere hosted in the cloud at cs50.dev,

1093
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:23,129
the URL I mentioned last week,

1094
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:24,929
and we're going to tease this apart in just a moment.

1095
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:25,689
That

1096
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:29,260
software is running on a computer and that computer's got a hard drive.

1097
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,675
or solid state drive like folders of storage,

1098
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:33,084
those files CS50.

1099
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:36,534
H and Standard IO.h and many more are pre-installed

1100
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,604
on the server to which I have connected,

1101
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,645
and they're stored in a standard place so that the

1102
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:43,395
compiler in particular knows where to look for them.

1103
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,594
And those are all things we did in advance for you,

1104
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:46,004
yeah.

1105
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,209
and not create a new like a new line.

1106
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,899
Why does the backslash N not create a new line?

1107
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:57,409
So it is backslash N is essentially being printed here,

1108
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:00,860
which has the effect of pushing the dollar sign to the next line,

1109
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:04,330
otherwise the dollar sign would stay on that second to last line.

1110
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,409
Other questions?

1111
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,830
Good,

1112
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,320
uh,

1113
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,110
why is there no backslash N over here?

1114
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,229
Good question.

1115
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,639
My choice as the programmer.

1116
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,510
I just wanted to see the sentence.

1117
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,209
What's your name?

1118
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:21,010
question mark and I wanted the user me to type my name immediately after it like this,

1119
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,919
but I didn't have to do it that way.

1120
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,590
I just wanted to show you the difference.

1121
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:25,159
Got you.

1122
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,959
And then also like just generally when we're like doing like

1123
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:31,280
the what actually always write the like first four lines.

1124
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,790
Should you always write the 1st 4?

1125
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,020
Oh,

1126
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,560
these?

1127
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,139
Yes,

1128
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,159
for today,

1129
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:37,439
trust me,

1130
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,010
do this,

1131
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,330
do this,

1132
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:38,639
do this,

1133
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:39,050
do this,

1134
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:41,800
and next week we'll understand even more what those lines do.

1135
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:42,250
However,

1136
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:47,040
slight caveat only use CS 50.H if you're using one of our functions.

1137
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,409
Clearly you don't need CS 50.H if you're just

1138
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,550
printing something out as in the first example.

1139
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:52,530
Other questions?

1140
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,570
dividing the first input and the second input.

1141
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:01,479
I understand that the second input is what I typed as the user,

1142
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,719
but the first input does not really feel like input

1143
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:07,000
for me because that's the question that you ask.

1144
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,010
Can you like.

1145
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,750
Correct.

1146
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,189
So to summarize the question on the right here,

1147
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,500
this input is effectively provided by the user.

1148
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,590
This first input though is provided by me.

1149
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,360
That's the way it is.

1150
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:24,949
So these are both inputs because they're being provided as inputs to the function.

1151
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:29,919
The origins of those inputs though are entirely up to what I'm trying to achieve.

1152
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,439
The first one I know in advance,

1153
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:32,260
like I'm the programmer,

1154
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,629
I know I wanted to say hello

1155
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:34,949
someone.

1156
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,669
The second input I don't know in advance,

1157
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:40,959
so I'm using a place I'm using a variable to store the value that

1158
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:44,510
I'm going to get when the get string function is used later on,

1159
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,760
but they're both inputs even though they're used in different ways.

1160
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:48,520
Good question.

1161
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:49,739
Any others?

1162
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:51,120
Yeah,

1163
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:51,139
OK,

1164
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,370
so

1165
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,850
if we now have

1166
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:55,889
that done,

1167
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,040
well,

1168
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,899
let's just take a step back into the first question

1169
00:43:57,899 --> 00:44:00,580
that was just asked about where are these files.

1170
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,899
Let's take a look back at actually what it is we're actually using here.

1171
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:04,820
So it turns out,

1172
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,500
even though most of you are using Mac OS or Windows,

1173
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,610
there's other operating systems out there in the world.

1174
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:11,050
Phones have iOS,

1175
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,360
iPads have iPad OS,

1176
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,219
Android devices have Android.

1177
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,840
Which is its own operating system.

1178
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:22,169
The operating systems in the world are the pieces of software that really

1179
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:25,679
just do the most fundamental operations on a device like booting it up,

1180
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,500
shutting it down,

1181
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:27,770
sending something to a printer,

1182
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:29,080
displaying something on the screen,

1183
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:32,530
managing windows and icons and all of that sort of commodity

1184
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,280
stuff that is used by other people's software as well.

1185
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:38,610
A very popular operating system in the programming world and in the

1186
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,449
world of servers in the cloud and on the internet at.

1187
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,870
It's called Linux,

1188
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:45,080
and it's a descendant of something called Unix,

1189
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,030
which has been around for quite some time,

1190
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,199
and it's what many programmers,

1191
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,560
most programmers use depending on their environments

1192
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,479
insofar as Linux is very highly performance,

1193
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:58,800
like you can support thousands of millions of users

1194
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,949
on servers running an operating system like this.

1195
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,979
It tends not to,

1196
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,340
but it can have a graphical user interface,

1197
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,679
which just means it can operate more quickly because it does.

1198
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,350
Need all of these graphics that are really just for humans' benefits,

1199
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:12,469
not necessarily for web browsers and other devices,

1200
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,419
and Linux,

1201
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:18,199
insofar as it's usually used or often used as a command line interface,

1202
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,939
comes with a whole bunch of commands that you'll start to use and see over time.

1203
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,459
Now I've used a bunch of commands already.

1204
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,399
I've used code,

1205
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,699
which is a VS code thing.

1206
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:27,000
I have used Make,

1207
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,370
which is for today's purposes our compiler,

1208
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,949
but that's a little white lie that we'll distill next week.

1209
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:34,489
And then I've used hello,

1210
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:38,449
which is a command I essentially invented as soon as I created a program

1211
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:39,840
called Hello.

1212
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,929
But there's a bunch of other ones as well.

1213
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,540
For instance,

1214
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,620
if I want to list the files in my current folder,

1215
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,169
I can type LS and hit enter for short.

1216
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,449
If I want to create a new folder,

1217
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:51,659
otherwise known as a directory,

1218
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:54,770
I can use MKDIR to make a directory.

1219
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:56,280
If I want to remove a directory,

1220
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,179
I can use RM.

1221
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:57,850
Director.

1222
00:45:57,969 --> 00:45:59,010
If I want to remove a file,

1223
00:45:59,050 --> 00:45:59,729
I can use RM.

1224
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,010
If I want to rename a file,

1225
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,969
I can use MV for move.

1226
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,290
If I want to copy a file,

1227
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:04,659
CP,

1228
00:46:04,689 --> 00:46:05,929
if I want to change directories,

1229
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,399
change into a folder,

1230
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:08,649
I can use CD.

1231
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:11,560
Now these two just take a little bit of time and practice to memorize them,

1232
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:14,729
and they're all very terse insofar as the whole point of

1233
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:18,439
a command line interface is to let people navigate things quickly.

1234
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:19,610
So for instance,

1235
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:21,209
even though this will be a bit of a whirlwind,

1236
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,370
let me go back into

1237
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:23,800
VS code

1238
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,909
and let me propose that we play around with just a

1239
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,040
few of these commands so that you've seen me doing it,

1240
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:31,209
but generally speaking in CS 50's problem sets,

1241
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,639
we will tell you step by step what commands to type

1242
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:36,889
so that you can achieve the same results and then later

1243
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:39,889
in the term we'll stop bothering reminding you pedantically how to

1244
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,520
do this and that because it should come more naturally eventually.

1245
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:44,280
But for instance,

1246
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,169
let me go ahead and do this.

1247
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:45,790
Let me go ahead.

1248
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:49,027
And reopen my file explorer at left.

1249
00:46:49,346 --> 00:46:50,517
Yours will look a little different.

1250
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:52,596
You'll have a different number as your unique ID,

1251
00:46:52,636 --> 00:46:56,437
but generally you'll see whatever files and or folders you've created already.

1252
00:46:56,636 --> 00:46:58,717
The first thing I created today was called hello.c.

1253
00:46:59,156 --> 00:47:00,616
and then by using Make,

1254
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,666
I created a second file I claimed called hello.

1255
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:08,836
So the reasonhello works is because there is in fact a program called hello.

1256
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,694
In my current folder,

1257
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:11,813
ergot

1258
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:15,733
that was created when I compiled my source code into machine code.

1259
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:18,053
Now suppose for the sake of discussion that

1260
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,343
this is going to get messy quickly because the more

1261
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:22,263
programs we create in class and for problem sets,

1262
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:26,214
you're just going to have a hot mess of files inside of this one main folder.

1263
00:47:26,424 --> 00:47:26,474
Well,

1264
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:28,664
let's create subfolders like you might be inclined to do

1265
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:31,293
on your Mac or PC or Google Drive or whatnot.

1266
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:31,904
What we can do.

1267
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,200
This in a bunch of ways.

1268
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,371
I could right click or control click on my File

1269
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:41,611
Explorer and I'll see a somewhat familiar contextual menu and I

1270
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:45,091
can literally choose new folder or I can rename things or

1271
00:47:45,091 --> 00:47:47,361
I can move things around by dragging and dropping them.

1272
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:47,891
But for today,

1273
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,170
let's focus more on the CLI,

1274
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,490
the command line interface,

1275
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,190
and again commands like this.

1276
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,930
So let me go back into VS code.

1277
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:58,870
And let me propose that we do a few things just because as a tour.

1278
00:47:59,159 --> 00:47:59,379
First,

1279
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:00,989
let me delete the machine code.

1280
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,550
I'm done with this example.

1281
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,310
I don't really want to keep these bits around unnecessarily.

1282
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:06,320
I'm going to delete hello,

1283
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,159
not hello.c,

1284
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,229
but hello,

1285
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,669
the compiled program.

1286
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:10,639
When I type that,

1287
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,879
I'll be cautioned,

1288
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,199
remove the regular file,

1289
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:14,040
whatever that means,

1290
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:14,949
called hello.

1291
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,790
Here I'm being prompted for a yes no response.

1292
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:18,719
Y suffices.

1293
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,770
So I'm going to hit Y enter and watch what happens

1294
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,820
at top left as soon as I use my terminal window

1295
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,080
and this command.

1296
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,979
To remove that file,

1297
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:27,870
it disappears.

1298
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,909
I could have right clicked on it or control clicked on it,

1299
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,419
but this command line interface achieves the same thing.

1300
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:35,790
Now suppose that for problem set one and future problem sets,

1301
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,590
I want to keep like every program I write

1302
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,110
in its own folder just to keep myself organized,

1303
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:41,739
especially as the term progresses.

1304
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:42,020
Well,

1305
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,500
let me create a new folder

1306
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,949
called hello itself.

1307
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,739
So I don't want to create a program called hello.

1308
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,100
I want to create a folder called hello.

1309
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,139
One way I can do this per this here cheat sheet

1310
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,729
is to make a directory,

1311
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,040
which just means folder.

1312
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,560
So MK DIR,

1313
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,580
hello enter and you'll see a top left.

1314
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:03,239
Now I indeed have a folder and it even has an obvious folder icon next to it.

1315
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:04,719
Now I could cut some corners.

1316
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:07,649
I could click and drag on hello.c and just drop it into hello,

1317
00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:08,199
but again,

1318
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:10,159
let's stick with the command line interface.

1319
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,120
Let me go ahead now and move

1320
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,370
MV for short.

1321
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,899
Hello.c into hello.

1322
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,800
So this is the first command where I'm passing in not

1323
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,179
one word after the command like code hello.c or make hello.

1324
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,750
Now I'm typing two words after the command

1325
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,659
because the way the move command is designed

1326
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:35,669
is to expect the origin as the first word and the destination as the second,

1327
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:36,459
so to speak,

1328
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:37,370
whereby

1329
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,979
if I want to rename hello.

1330
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:39,560
sorry,

1331
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,659
if I want to move hello.c into the hello folder.

1332
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,550
I should type like this.

1333
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:45,540
Now you can,

1334
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:46,500
just so you know,

1335
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,050
include a trailing slash,

1336
00:49:49,229 --> 00:49:53,229
a forward slash at the end of the destination just to make clear that you

1337
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:58,139
want to put this into a folder and not just rename Hello.c to hello,

1338
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,629
but because the hello folder already exists,

1339
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:04,070
Linux knows what it's doing and it's just going to assume that when you do that,

1340
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:05,580
watch what happens at the top left.

1341
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,310
Hello.c seems to have disappeared,

1342
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,939
but if I click this little triangle,

1343
00:50:09,149 --> 00:50:09,409
ah,

1344
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:10,070
there it is,

1345
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,860
it's now inside of that folder.

1346
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:12,629
But now I've created.

1347
00:50:12,716 --> 00:50:14,135
Kind of a predict for myself.

1348
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:15,656
Let me clear my terminal window

1349
00:50:15,906 --> 00:50:17,976
and now let me type LS.

1350
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:20,256
And when I type LS for list,

1351
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:23,216
you'll see only a folder called hello,

1352
00:50:23,345 --> 00:50:26,625
and it's color coded just to call it out to your eyes and there's a trailing slash

1353
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,065
just to make obvious that it's a folder

1354
00:50:28,065 --> 00:50:29,986
that's all done automatically for you by Linux,

1355
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:31,095
the operating system.

1356
00:50:31,305 --> 00:50:31,855
But wait a minute,

1357
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:33,585
where did my hello program go?

1358
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,226
Like where is hello.c?

1359
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:35,706
Well,

1360
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:36,936
it's in that folder,

1361
00:50:37,065 --> 00:50:40,016
so I need to change into that folder or directory.

1362
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,385
And here per the cheat sheet we have CD for.

1363
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:45,691
directory so I can do CD space hello,

1364
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:48,291
with or without the slash and hit enter,

1365
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:49,461
and now you'll see this,

1366
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,132
and it's admittedly a little cryptic,

1367
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:55,062
but my prompt has now changed to still be a dollar sign,

1368
00:50:55,102 --> 00:51:00,011
but before it is just a constant reminder of where what folder I am in.

1369
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:01,981
We adopted this as a convention.

1370
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,221
Many systems do the same thing,

1371
00:51:03,322 --> 00:51:04,812
though the formatting might be a little different.

1372
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:08,461
This is just to help you remember where the heck you are without having to

1373
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:12,062
type some other command to ask the operating system what folder you are in.

1374
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,780
So now that I'm here,

1375
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,550
if I type LS and hit enter,

1376
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,459
what should I see?

1377
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,689
Just hello.c because that's the only thing in that their folder.

1378
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,959
So now let's do maybe one other thing.

1379
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,350
Let's do make hello inside of this folder.

1380
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,590
That is OK and notice at top left what just happened.

1381
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,189
Now I've got both files back.

1382
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:33,560
All right,

1383
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,030
suppose I want to get rid of one well I can do RM hello again.

1384
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,669
I can type Y for yes to confirm the deletion,

1385
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,429
and now I'm back to where I just was.

1386
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,120
Now suppose I want to do yet other things,

1387
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,070
suppose that I'm not really proud of this version of hello.c.

1388
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:47,070
Let me keep it,

1389
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,360
but.

1390
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,360
Rename it.

1391
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:48,879
Well,

1392
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,750
I can say

1393
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,659
how about MV hello.c to old.c.

1394
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,989
I just want to rename the file so MV can be used not only to physically move a file

1395
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,590
from one place to another.

1396
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,399
If you use it on two file names,

1397
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:03,449
it will just rename the file for you.

1398
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,040
So there's no rename command that you need to use instead.

1399
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:06,679
Uh,

1400
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:07,129
but you know what,

1401
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:07,370
nope,

1402
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:09,159
I regret that this program was fine.

1403
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,040
Let's name it back.

1404
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:14,199
So let's move old.c back to hello.c and watch it top left.

1405
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:16,179
It just renames the file again.

1406
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:16,629
Um,

1407
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:17,939
let me go ahead and make a backup though.

1408
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,709
So let me copy with CP,

1409
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,209
hello.c into a file called like backup.c just in case I screw this up.

1410
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,639
I want to have a spare around.

1411
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:26,689
Now you see at the top left,

1412
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:27,570
I've got both files.

1413
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,729
If I now type out less,

1414
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:30,129
you'll see both files.

1415
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:33,936
So what's happening in the GUI is the exact same thing is happening in the CLI,

1416
00:52:34,145 --> 00:52:34,535
but you know what,

1417
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:35,946
this was just for demonstration's sake.

1418
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,775
I don't need any of this,

1419
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:38,216
so let me remove the backup,

1420
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:39,855
say yes for why.

1421
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:43,335
Let me go ahead and move hello.c out of this folder,

1422
00:52:43,545 --> 00:52:45,345
which I could just kind of drag and drop it,

1423
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:46,535
but how do I move

1424
00:52:46,785 --> 00:52:47,815
hello.c

1425
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:49,385
to the parent folder,

1426
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:49,825
so to speak?

1427
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:51,375
I want to move it out of this folder.

1428
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:51,585
Well,

1429
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,815
you would only know this by having been told.

1430
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:58,271
is special notation that means the so-called parent folder.

1431
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:00,191
So go back up in the hierarchy.

1432
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:01,751
And now if it's not obvious,

1433
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:03,082
a single dot,

1434
00:53:03,322 --> 00:53:04,162
which we have seen before,

1435
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:05,352
means this folder,

1436
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,191
two dots means one step up.

1437
00:53:08,362 --> 00:53:10,082
There's no triple dots or quadruple dots.

1438
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:11,231
You have to use different syntax,

1439
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:12,872
but more on that another time.

1440
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:18,041
So watch what happens when I do move hello.c up into the parent directory.

1441
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:19,639
Notice at top left

1442
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:22,370
that the indentation changed because it's no longer

1443
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,360
inside of that same folder and heck,

1444
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,760
now I'm going to go ahead and do this.

1445
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:28,530
I could go back to my main folder by doing CD.

1446
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,360
to back out of this folder,

1447
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:31,100
but

1448
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:34,340
when in doubt or if you ever get yourself into a confusing mess,

1449
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:37,409
just type CD enter alone and you'll be

1450
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:40,280
magically whisked away to your default folder,

1451
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:41,449
a home directory,

1452
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:41,969
so to speak,

1453
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,840
even though that too is a bit of a white lie,

1454
00:53:44,129 --> 00:53:45,560
so that will lead you.

1455
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:50,679
Always where you're starting when logging in to CS50.dev AKA VS code,

1456
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:53,580
and now I can see the folder which happens to be empty,

1457
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:54,639
and the file.

1458
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:59,750
So let me go and do one last command or hello to really undo

1459
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,199
all of the work such that we're now back to where the story began.

1460
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,820
But the point here is just to demonstrate

1461
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,060
that with these basic fundamental commands you can

1462
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:12,149
do everything that you've taken for granted on Macs and PCs for years with a mouse

1463
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:13,199
instead.

1464
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:14,330
Questions.

1465
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,030
On any of these here Linux commands,

1466
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,429
yeah.

1467
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,379
Really good question.

1468
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:26,860
If you have 5 different files in a folder,

1469
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:28,219
how can you choose which one to open?

1470
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,350
Well,

1471
00:54:28,419 --> 00:54:29,610
you can certainly do code,

1472
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,139
space,

1473
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:32,290
and the name of the file you want to open,

1474
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,260
or we're going to see other tricks like you can use an asterisk or

1475
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,129
a star for a so-called wildcard and say open everything in this folder,

1476
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:41,020
and you can even use more precise patterns than that.

1477
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:41,620
So over time,

1478
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:43,260
once we have more files at my disposal,

1479
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,659
I'll be able to do tricks like that as well too.

1480
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:46,030
Yeah.

1481
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:51,620
Yeah

1482
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,389
Uh-huh.

1483
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,500
So when you like delete the file,

1484
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:56,590
uh what was that?

1485
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:57,689
Hello

1486
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,600
How did

1487
00:55:03,899 --> 00:55:04,100
Sure,

1488
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:08,100
so one of the things I did in my VS code a moment ago was once I was

1489
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,649
inside of the Hello folder into which I had

1490
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:13,010
put hello.c just for the sake of discussion,

1491
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,290
I then recompiled it by running Make hello,

1492
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,290
and this example is a little confusing,

1493
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,979
deliberately insofar as I've got a file called hello.c

1494
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,449
inside of a folder called hello,

1495
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,899
but because I compiled Hello.C,

1496
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,889
I then created a program called Helloo as well.

1497
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:32,020
But that program he was inside of.

1498
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:34,040
folder called hello,

1499
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,020
which is only to say that you can totally do this.

1500
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,679
You can't have a file in a folder

1501
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:40,770
in the same place name the same thing because they would collide.

1502
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,879
Like you can't do that on a Mac or a PC as well.

1503
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:43,969
You have to have unique names,

1504
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,850
but you can certainly put something inside of another folder without collision.

1505
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:48,729
Good question.

1506
00:55:49,419 --> 00:55:49,780
All right,

1507
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,729
so let's introduce a few more

1508
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,100
building blocks and a few more things we can do.

1509
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:55,830
So besides these Linux commands,

1510
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,330
which we'll now start taking for granted,

1511
00:55:57,459 --> 00:56:01,020
we have a bunch of other features of programming languages that we saw in Scratch.

1512
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,290
Let's now translate them to C.

1513
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,129
So conditionals were sort of the proverbial fork in the road,

1514
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:09,570
enabling you to do this or this or some other thing based on the answer to a question,

1515
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,370
a so-called boolean expression.

1516
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:11,810
Here,

1517
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:12,300
for instance,

1518
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:16,929
in Scratch is how we might express if a variable X is less than a variable y.

1519
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:20,781
We'll go ahead and say x is less than y and out of context,

1520
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,031
I didn't include it in the slide,

1521
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:26,281
presumably we've created X and Y and somehow given them values,

1522
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:26,971
whatever they are,

1523
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:29,711
but this is just now the conditional part of the program.

1524
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:30,602
In C,

1525
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:34,271
the way you would do the same thing is you would say if and then a space,

1526
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:35,721
then parentheses,

1527
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:37,122
which have nothing to do with functions.

1528
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:38,991
If is not a function,

1529
00:56:39,082 --> 00:56:42,322
it is a feature of C that implements conditionals just

1530
00:56:42,322 --> 00:56:44,802
like this orange block is a feature of scratch.

1531
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:47,733
Inside of the parentheses you put your same Boolean expression.

1532
00:56:47,823 --> 00:56:49,134
So here too out of context,

1533
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:51,964
if up here I have defined variables X and Y,

1534
00:56:52,224 --> 00:56:54,664
well I can certainly use them in this conditional and I can use

1535
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:58,503
this less than operator just like in math class to ask this question.

1536
00:56:58,533 --> 00:56:59,134
And the answer,

1537
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:00,533
even though it's a less than sign,

1538
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:03,934
is indeed if you think about it going to be true or false,

1539
00:57:04,063 --> 00:57:04,783
yes or no,

1540
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:06,174
it's a boolean expression.

1541
00:57:06,184 --> 00:57:08,293
It either is less than or it is not.

1542
00:57:08,454 --> 00:57:08,664
All right,

1543
00:57:08,904 --> 00:57:11,253
inside of the curly braces which are necessary here,

1544
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:12,624
I'm just going to literally put.

1545
00:57:12,815 --> 00:57:13,835
Old friend print F,

1546
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:17,906
and there's nothing interesting here except the new phrase X is less than y

1547
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:18,845
with the backslash N,

1548
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:19,555
the semicolon,

1549
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:20,446
and the parentheses.

1550
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:21,645
This though is deliberate,

1551
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:22,875
just like in Scratch.

1552
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:28,916
The say is sort of indented and sort of hugged by the if orange puzzle piece.

1553
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:29,736
Similarly,

1554
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:31,246
do these curly braces,

1555
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,125
are they meant to sort of imply the same?

1556
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:34,885
It's sort of embracing these lines of code.

1557
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:35,795
As an aside,

1558
00:57:36,006 --> 00:57:36,686
in C,

1559
00:57:36,926 --> 00:57:38,436
they're not always necessary.

1560
00:57:38,466 --> 00:57:39,595
If you have a single line of code,

1561
00:57:39,645 --> 00:57:40,525
you can technically omit.

1562
00:57:40,677 --> 00:57:40,988
However,

1563
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,258
what you'll see

1564
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:45,377
in C as well as in CS 150 in particular,

1565
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:49,508
we will generally preach a certain style like any company in the real world would

1566
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,788
do so that programmers who are collaborating on

1567
00:57:51,788 --> 00:57:54,137
code all write code that looks the same

1568
00:57:54,748 --> 00:57:56,097
so that it doesn't

1569
00:57:56,508 --> 00:57:59,187
devolve into a mess because everyone has their own convention.

1570
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:00,667
So this is a convention to which you

1571
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:03,808
should indeed adhere and then I've indented 4 spaces

1572
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:06,107
to make clear logically that this line of code

1573
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,427
only executes if the answer to this question.

1574
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:09,590
Is true

1575
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:10,860
or yes.

1576
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,439
Meanwhile,

1577
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,070
in scratch,

1578
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,679
if we had an if E condition,

1579
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,070
so a two-way fork in the road,

1580
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,290
if X is less than Y,

1581
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,580
say so el say x is not less than Y.

1582
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:20,790
How can I do that in C?

1583
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,159
Well,

1584
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:22,550
if X less than Y,

1585
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:23,550
something

1586
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:24,590
else,

1587
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,550
something else.

1588
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,479
And what are the uh what goes in between those curly braces?

1589
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:28,719
Well,

1590
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,040
just two different print Fs.

1591
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,469
X is less than Y or X is not less than Y.

1592
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,439
The only new thing here is we've added Ls and another pair of curly.

1593
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,530
Races just like we've got sort of two orange

1594
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,159
shapes hugging those two purple puzzle pieces there.

1595
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:43,530
All right,

1596
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,679
how about something a little more involved

1597
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,290
and this looks like it's escalating quickly,

1598
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,679
but it's just because the scratch puzzle pieces are so big.

1599
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:50,250
If X is less than Y,

1600
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:50,719
then

1601
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,219
say X is less than Y.

1602
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,739
else if X is greater than Y,

1603
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,659
then say X is greater than Y.

1604
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:59,010
else if X equals Y,

1605
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,219
then say X is equal to y.

1606
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:02,719
How can we do this in C?

1607
00:59:03,169 --> 00:59:04,280
Almost the same idea.

1608
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,850
If X less than Y,

1609
00:59:05,939 --> 00:59:07,409
if X greater than Y,

1610
00:59:07,479 --> 00:59:10,189
L X equals equals Y.

1611
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:10,739
Well,

1612
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,979
before we reveal what's in the curly braces,

1613
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,389
this is not a typo.

1614
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:20,159
Why have I presumably done this even if you've never used C before?

1615
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:20,629
Yeah.

1616
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,330
sit

1617
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:25,939
Exactly,

1618
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,250
the single equal sign,

1619
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,969
which we've used already when storing a value from get string

1620
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:35,409
into a variable like answer is technically the assignment operator.

1621
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:39,330
So humans decades ago decided that when faced with a situation where they wanted

1622
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:42,850
to copy from the right to the left a return value into a variable,

1623
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,439
it made sort of visual sense to use an equal sign because you want those two things

1624
00:59:46,439 --> 00:59:49,689
ultimately to be equal even though you kind of read the code from right to left.

1625
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:50,590
In that case,

1626
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,919
I can only imagine at some point the same people were in the

1627
00:59:52,919 --> 00:59:55,239
room and they were coming up with the syntax for conditionals and like,

1628
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,149
oh shoot,

1629
00:59:56,399 --> 00:59:59,070
we've already used equals for assignment.

1630
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,560
What do we now use for equality and the solution in C as

1631
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,959
well as in many other languages is literally this they use 2.

1632
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,070
So this is the equality operator,

1633
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,590
whereas a single one is the assignment operator,

1634
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:11,699
and it's just because.

1635
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:13,320
Now Scratch is designed for kids,

1636
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,120
no sense of confus.

1637
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:15,949
using little kids with equal equal signs,

1638
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,300
so scratch uses a single equal sign,

1639
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,629
whereas C and most languages use double equal signs,

1640
01:00:21,669 --> 01:00:23,139
so a minor divergence there.

1641
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,469
What goes in the curly braces,

1642
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,550
nothing all that interesting,

1643
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:27,429
just a bunch more print Fs.

1644
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,000
But here's an opportunity to distinguish not only the

1645
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,379
equivalence of this scratch code with C code,

1646
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,860
but a missed design opportunity that we sort of tripped over,

1647
01:00:35,949 --> 01:00:37,379
if briefly last week.

1648
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:38,870
This is arguably

1649
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:40,500
not well designed,

1650
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:41,949
even though it is correct.

1651
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,209
Why,

1652
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:46,350
yeah.

1653
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,500
Yeah,

1654
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,820
we don't need to ask this third boolean expression.

1655
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:52,939
Is X equal equal toy,

1656
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:53,729
so to speak?

1657
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:53,840
Well,

1658
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:54,500
logically,

1659
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,540
if we're using sort of normal person numbers,

1660
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,810
it's either less than or greater than or by default equal to.

1661
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,709
So you're just wasting the computer's time and in

1662
01:01:02,709 --> 01:01:05,379
turn the user's time by asking this third question.

1663
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:10,304
So slightly better here would be get Of the ELTS if just have a default case,

1664
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:11,225
an ETS block,

1665
01:01:11,304 --> 01:01:11,905
so to speak,

1666
01:01:12,104 --> 01:01:13,254
that looks like this.

1667
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,705
If it stands to reason that there's only 3 possibilities,

1668
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:18,625
you only really need to interrogate 2 of them out of the 3.

1669
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:19,875
So a minor optimization,

1670
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:22,614
but you can imagine doing that again and again and again in your code.

1671
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:25,225
You don't want to be wasting the computer or the

1672
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:27,745
user's time if you can improve things like that.

1673
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:28,540
All right,

1674
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:31,729
so now that we have these equivalences between

1675
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,489
scratch code and C code for these conditionals,

1676
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:34,620
well,

1677
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:36,300
what other things can we throw into the mix?

1678
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:36,729
Well,

1679
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:38,639
C has a whole bunch of operators,

1680
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:40,409
and just so that you've seen a list in one place,

1681
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,409
you've got not only assignments and less than and greater than in equality,

1682
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,409
but a few others here as well.

1683
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:46,739
Now,

1684
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,979
even though in like Microsoft Word and Google Docs

1685
01:01:48,979 --> 01:01:50,850
you can kind of do a greater than or.

1686
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:54,875
to sign one over the other or less than or equal to in C,

1687
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:55,935
in most languages,

1688
01:01:56,014 --> 01:01:57,735
you actually just hit the keyboard twice.

1689
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:59,685
You do the less than and an equal sign,

1690
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:02,205
or you do a greater than and the equal sign,

1691
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:04,735
and that's how you achieve the notion of greater than or equal

1692
01:02:04,735 --> 01:02:07,784
to or less than or equal to this one we've seen.

1693
01:02:07,885 --> 01:02:08,935
Anyone want to guess what

1694
01:02:09,385 --> 01:02:11,175
exclamation point equals means,

1695
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:13,395
otherwise pronounced bang equals?

1696
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:13,735
Yeah.

1697
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:15,679
Not equal.

1698
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,729
So generally in programming you'll see an exclamation

1699
01:02:18,729 --> 01:02:21,120
point implying the negation of something else,

1700
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:21,929
the opposite.

1701
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,729
So you don't want it to be equal to,

1702
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,439
you want it to be not equal to.

1703
01:02:25,489 --> 01:02:26,479
Now you might think,

1704
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:27,560
shouldn't it be

1705
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,540
not equal equal?

1706
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:30,290
Yes,

1707
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,010
but they're trying to save keystrokes.

1708
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,040
So this is the negation of that,

1709
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:37,000
even though it doesn't quite look like it should be,

1710
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,689
just 2 characters instead of 3.

1711
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,469
Um,

1712
01:02:40,209 --> 01:02:42,139
and there's many other operators that won't encounter

1713
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:44,080
in the wild over time.

1714
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:44,350
Um,

1715
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,419
but there's also worth noting in C,

1716
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:47,870
more than just strings,

1717
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:49,629
like strings we call were strings of text,

1718
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:51,030
and there's other types of

1719
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:51,689
Uh,

1720
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,290
data that you might get from a user or store we've seen string,

1721
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,340
but we'll actually see a whole bunch of others.

1722
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:58,300
So in C

1723
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:03,139
we're going to see boos themselves of a variable that can be true or false,

1724
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:03,770
and that's it.

1725
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,810
So very much interrelated with Boolean expressions.

1726
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,810
A variable itself can be true or false.

1727
01:03:07,899 --> 01:03:10,020
We're going to see chars or characters,

1728
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:13,889
so not strings of text like multiple letters and words and the like,

1729
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,570
but just individual characters.

1730
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:15,969
See,

1731
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,100
unlike some languages.

1732
01:03:17,245 --> 01:03:20,875
Does distinguish between single characters and multiple characters.

1733
01:03:21,354 --> 01:03:21,675
Double,

1734
01:03:21,915 --> 01:03:23,074
or rather let's jump to float.

1735
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:25,915
A float is otherwise known as a floating point value,

1736
01:03:25,955 --> 01:03:28,465
which is just a number that has a decimal point in it,

1737
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,145
a real number if you will,

1738
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:36,554
but a float generally uses nowadays 32 bits total to represent those numbers.

1739
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:39,274
The catch with that is that how many total values

1740
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:43,074
can you represent with 32 bits roughly per last week.

1741
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,110
It's one of the few numbers I propose you remember it's like roughly 4 billion,

1742
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,429
but how many real numbers are there in the world according to math class?

1743
01:03:52,419 --> 01:03:53,429
An infinite number.

1744
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:56,320
So we seem to have a mismatch between what we can represent

1745
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,159
in code and how many actual numbers there are in the world.

1746
01:03:59,330 --> 01:03:59,530
OK,

1747
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,399
so not to worry,

1748
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,770
if you need more precision,

1749
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,229
like more significant digits,

1750
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:03,370
well,

1751
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:04,659
you can upgrade your variables,

1752
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:05,090
so to speak,

1753
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:06,169
from a float to a double,

1754
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:07,830
which uses 64 bits,

1755
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:09,169
which is way more precise,

1756
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,280
twice as many bits,

1757
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,969
but it doesn't fundamentally solve the problem because

1758
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:15,330
really it's still finite and not infinite,

1759
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:18,290
and we'll end today with a look at what the real world implications of that are.

1760
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:19,879
But besides floating point values,

1761
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:22,149
there's just simple integers 012,

1762
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,270
and the negatives thereof,

1763
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,969
but those conventionally used 32 bits,

1764
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:30,139
which means the highest a computer can count using an in would be 4 billion.

1765
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:31,969
But if you want to do negative numbers,

1766
01:04:31,989 --> 01:04:33,550
it's going to be roughly 2 billion,

1767
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:35,600
so you can go all the way to negative 2 billion.

1768
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,709
So that's not that large nowadays.

1769
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:39,350
Along uses 64 bits,

1770
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,070
which is a much bigger range of values,

1771
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:43,360
but there too still finite,

1772
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,270
and there's a bunch of.

1773
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:45,409
Others as well.

1774
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:50,169
So these are just the types of data that we can store and manipulate in our programs,

1775
01:04:50,209 --> 01:04:51,479
but a couple of those now,

1776
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:53,379
do

1777
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:54,370
a couple of those,

1778
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:58,580
one in particular specifically come from CS50.H. So

1779
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,459
among the things you get by including CS50.

1780
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,600
H in your code is access to not only get string,

1781
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:06,169
but these other functions as well.

1782
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,300
And we'll start to use these in a little bit whereby you can get integers or chars.

1783
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,310
Doubles or floats.

1784
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,310
We don't have a get bol because it's not really

1785
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,979
useful to just get a true or false value typically,

1786
01:05:16,189 --> 01:05:17,350
but we could have invented it.

1787
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:18,270
We just chose not to.

1788
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:20,310
But we'll frequently use these here functions

1789
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:22,860
that you can access by using

1790
01:05:23,189 --> 01:05:24,820
that there header file.

1791
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:27,739
But where are we going to put these values and how are we going to display them?

1792
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:28,500
Well,

1793
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,830
turns out there's more than just percent S.

1794
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,260
So percents was a placeholder for a string,

1795
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,149
but if you want to print out something like a char.

1796
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,600
Single character you're actually going to use percent C.

1797
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,810
If you want to print out a floating point value,

1798
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,899
you're going to use percent F,

1799
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:44,479
an integer percent I,

1800
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,840
and a long integer that is a long,

1801
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,810
you're going to use LI instead.

1802
01:05:49,899 --> 01:05:50,330
So in short,

1803
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,209
there are solutions to all of these problems.

1804
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:55,719
These are not intellectually interesting details,

1805
01:05:55,729 --> 01:05:57,169
but they are useful,

1806
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,719
practical things to eventually absorb

1807
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:00,949
over time.

1808
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,209
So let's go ahead and do.

1809
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,530
Let's do just a few more examples together in a little bit we'll adjourn for

1810
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:10,469
a short break during which snacks will be served every week out in the transit.

1811
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,020
But before we get to that,

1812
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,350
let's focus on these here variables.

1813
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:16,300
So in Scratch we had the ability

1814
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,270
to store a bunch of values in variables that

1815
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,790
we could create ourselves by creating new puzzle pieces.

1816
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:23,860
In C you can essentially achieve the same.

1817
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:24,879
So for instance,

1818
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:28,189
suppose that in Scratch we wanted to keep track of someone's score.

1819
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,199
Using a counter,

1820
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:29,439
well,

1821
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:31,850
we might create a variable called counter and set it

1822
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,600
initially to 0 and then eventually add 1 to it,

1823
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,610
add 2 to it,

1824
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:38,919
and so forth as they drop trash into the trash can for instance.

1825
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:39,179
Well,

1826
01:06:39,209 --> 01:06:41,760
in C you're going to do something almost the same.

1827
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:45,649
You can choose the name of your variable just like I did previously with answers.

1828
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,760
You can assign it a value like 0 initially,

1829
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:49,320
but

1830
01:06:49,649 --> 01:06:50,479
per earlier,

1831
01:06:50,729 --> 01:06:54,120
what more am I probably going to have to do in C on the right hand side here?

1832
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:55,270
Yeah.

1833
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,550
I got to give it a type

1834
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,189
and a counter insofar as it's numeric is not going to be a string of text,

1835
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,320
and I don't think I need to worry about decimal

1836
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,709
points if I'm just counting the equivalent on my fingers.

1837
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,629
So int will suffice and in is the go to number and at

1838
01:07:10,629 --> 01:07:14,169
least if 2 billion plus values is more than enough for your case,

1839
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,840
which this is going to be still one minor thing missing.

1840
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:17,820
Yeah.

1841
01:07:18,439 --> 01:07:20,120
The semicolon to finish the thought.

1842
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:23,149
So that on the right is the equivalent to doing this here on the left.

1843
01:07:23,379 --> 01:07:26,629
Suppose that in scratch you wanted to increment the counter and add 1 to the score,

1844
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,459
add 2 to the score,

1845
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:28,100
and so forth.

1846
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,239
It might look like this.

1847
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,479
Change counter by 1,

1848
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,429
implicitly going up unless you did negative,

1849
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,379
which would go down.

1850
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,840
In C you can do this actually in a few ways,

1851
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:38,780
and this looks a bit wrong at the moment.

1852
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,179
How can counter possibly equal counter plus 1?

1853
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,260
This does not mean equality per se.

1854
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:45,830
The single equal sign recalls.

1855
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:49,597
Assignment and it means take the value on the right and copy it to the

1856
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:53,468
value on the left or to the variable in this case on the left.

1857
01:07:53,718 --> 01:07:56,937
So this takes whatever the current value of counter is 0,

1858
01:07:57,238 --> 01:07:58,187
adds 1 to it,

1859
01:07:58,357 --> 01:07:59,978
and then stores that 1

1860
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:01,818
in the counter variable.

1861
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:02,998
So now the value is 1,

1862
01:08:03,008 --> 01:08:03,988
and if you do it again,

1863
01:08:04,117 --> 01:08:04,798
it goes to 2,

1864
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:05,667
it goes to 3,

1865
01:08:05,917 --> 01:08:06,657
goes to 4,

1866
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:07,548
and so forth.

1867
01:08:07,597 --> 01:08:08,077
But honestly,

1868
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:10,197
this incrementation technique is so common that

1869
01:08:10,197 --> 01:08:12,147
there's more shorthand notation for it.

1870
01:08:12,357 --> 01:08:13,197
You can also just do this.

1871
01:08:13,335 --> 01:08:15,095
Looks a little weird at first glance,

1872
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:18,875
but counter plus equals one semicolon does the exact same thing.

1873
01:08:18,925 --> 01:08:20,564
You can just type fewer keystrokes,

1874
01:08:20,645 --> 01:08:21,085
and honestly,

1875
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:24,595
doing this is so down common in C that you can even

1876
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:25,395
do this.

1877
01:08:25,524 --> 01:08:28,354
Counter plus plus does the exact same thing

1878
01:08:28,765 --> 01:08:30,286
by adding one to the variable.

1879
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:33,524
There's no plus plus plus or plus plus plus or more pluses.

1880
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:36,475
It's only for incrementing individual values by one.

1881
01:08:36,765 --> 01:08:38,845
So arguably this version and this version,

1882
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,005
albeit more verbose,

1883
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:40,536
are a little more.

1884
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,443
A tile because then you can add 2 or 3 or more

1885
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:44,363
at a time.

1886
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,332
And there are equivalents for you doing decrementation and doing

1887
01:08:47,653 --> 01:08:48,243
minus

1888
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:51,363
or the minus symbol more generally in there.

1889
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:52,054
All right,

1890
01:08:52,133 --> 01:08:54,844
so let's actually use this technique in some code.

1891
01:08:54,974 --> 01:08:57,443
Let me go back into VS code here.

1892
01:08:57,613 --> 01:09:00,133
Let me close my file explorer and let's go ahead and

1893
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:03,252
create maybe this time like a little calculator of sorts.

1894
01:09:03,332 --> 01:09:07,163
Let me propose that we implement a very baby calculator,

1895
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:07,733
or rather,

1896
01:09:07,813 --> 01:09:08,133
not even a.

1897
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:08,631
Calculator,

1898
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:08,702
yeah,

1899
01:09:08,782 --> 01:09:10,541
let's just compare some few values.

1900
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:16,051
So let me do this code of compare.c to create a brand new program called Compare.

1901
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:18,541
And then in here I'm going to do a bit of boilerplates.

1902
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,751
I'm going to go ahead and include CS 50.

1903
01:09:20,981 --> 01:09:21,221
H.

1904
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:23,971
I'm going to go ahead and include standard.io.H,

1905
01:09:24,221 --> 01:09:27,131
and I'm going to go ahead and do in Main void,

1906
01:09:27,301 --> 01:09:28,291
more on that next week.

1907
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:29,861
And then inside the curly braces,

1908
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:31,861
let's use these these new techniques.

1909
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:34,011
Let's give myself a variable called X

1910
01:09:34,221 --> 01:09:35,631
and set it equal to.

1911
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,180
The return value of get in,

1912
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:40,240
that other function I promised exists,

1913
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:42,839
and let's prompt the user for a value for

1914
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:45,459
X with a sentence like What's X question mark,

1915
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,750
and then a space just to nudge the cursor over.

1916
01:09:47,919 --> 01:09:49,540
Let's get another variable Y.

1917
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:53,479
Set it equal to get into again and ask the user this time what's Y,

1918
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,910
essentially using the same function twice but to get two different values.

1919
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:57,709
Now.

1920
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,959
Let's go ahead and do something pretty mindless.

1921
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:00,419
If

1922
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:02,220
X is less than Y,

1923
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:07,399
go ahead and print out with print FX is less than Y

1924
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:11,720
backslashn to move the cursor close semicolon.

1925
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,399
So it's not that interesting of a program,

1926
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:17,049
but it's at least dynamic in that now I'm prompting the user for two numbers.

1927
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,509
So let's do this Make compare enter

1928
01:10:20,169 --> 01:10:20,970
seems to have worked,

1929
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,649
and in fact I can check that it worked by

1930
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:25,089
typing what command to list the files in my directory.

1931
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,540
LS for short.

1932
01:10:27,709 --> 01:10:29,500
And now you'll see I've got hello.C,

1933
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,740
but no hello because I deleted that with RM a few minutes ago.

1934
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:35,140
I've got Compare.c which I just created,

1935
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,390
and then I've also got a program called Compare and the

1936
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,750
asterisk there is just a visual indicator that this is executable.

1937
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:42,140
It's a program you can run.

1938
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:43,819
It's not just a simple old file,

1939
01:10:44,029 --> 01:10:44,830
even though I didn't type.

1940
01:10:45,185 --> 01:10:46,674
As previously with hello,

1941
01:10:47,084 --> 01:10:50,564
it would have similarly had an asterisk next to it in this context,

1942
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:52,515
but you don't see that in the File Explorer.

1943
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:53,834
If I now do compare,

1944
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:53,964
well,

1945
01:10:54,044 --> 01:10:56,115
let's do something silly like 1 for X,

1946
01:10:56,404 --> 01:10:57,314
2 for Y.

1947
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:57,854
OK,

1948
01:10:57,924 --> 01:10:58,865
X is less than Y.

1949
01:10:59,024 --> 01:10:59,834
Let's do it again.

1950
01:11:00,604 --> 01:11:01,194
compare,

1951
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:02,365
2 for x,

1952
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:03,555
1 for Y.

1953
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:05,035
OK and I see

1954
01:11:05,484 --> 01:11:06,125
nothing.

1955
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:06,890
Well,

1956
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,000
why am I seeing nothing?

1957
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:08,229
Well,

1958
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:08,870
logically,

1959
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,600
I didn't have a condition for checking

1960
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:12,649
for greater than,

1961
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:13,609
let alone equal to.

1962
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:15,390
So let's enhance this a little bit.

1963
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:17,029
Let me go ahead and minimally say,

1964
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:17,209
right,

1965
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:19,589
else if x is not less than Y,

1966
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:24,850
let's go ahead and print out X is not less than Y backslash and close semicolon.

1967
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:27,319
So I'm at least handling that situation too.

1968
01:11:27,529 --> 01:11:28,839
Let me clear my terminal window,

1969
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,879
do make compare again,

1970
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:34,490
compare 1 and 2 works exactly the same.

1971
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:37,379
Now let me go ahead and do 2 and 1.

1972
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,379
There we have better output.

1973
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:44,020
Of course it's not really complete yet because if I do slash compare again

1974
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,509
and do 1 and 1,

1975
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:48,870
it'd be nice to be a little more specific than X is not less than Y.

1976
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,459
It's not wrong,

1977
01:11:49,589 --> 01:11:50,979
but it's not very precise.

1978
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:54,819
So I can add in to the mix what we did earlier and I can say,

1979
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:55,149
OK,

1980
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,540
well,

1981
01:11:55,549 --> 01:11:59,049
else if X is greater than Y.

1982
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:05,370
Say X is greater than Y else if X equals equals y,

1983
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:06,959
go ahead and print out

1984
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:10,290
X is equal toys.

1985
01:12:11,049 --> 01:12:14,779
But here too someone observed that this is sort of stupidly inefficient.

1986
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,729
What line of code should I actually improve here?

1987
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,220
To tighten this up,

1988
01:12:19,299 --> 01:12:19,549
yeah.

1989
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:21,200
if you could

1990
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:22,689
Yeah,

1991
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:23,649
so line 17,

1992
01:12:23,729 --> 01:12:24,810
I think I can just get rid of

1993
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:27,770
that unnecessary question because logically that's going to be

1994
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:32,120
the case at this point and now I can go ahead and recompile this with make compare

1995
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,149
compare again enter 1 and 1,

1996
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,879
and now we're back in business,

1997
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,439
catching all three of those situations,

1998
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:40,919
uh,

1999
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,479
those scenarios

2000
01:12:43,009 --> 01:12:43,479
there.

2001
01:12:44,839 --> 01:12:48,069
Questions on any of these things here.

2002
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:52,259
Why have I deliberately not done this?

2003
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:54,680
Let me rewind just a moment and let me hide my

2004
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,029
terminal window just to keep the emphasis on the code here.

2005
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:01,830
Why not do this and keep my code arguably simpler?

2006
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,350
Like,

2007
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:05,229
why not just ask three questions Step 9,

2008
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,790
step 13,

2009
01:13:06,879 --> 01:13:08,709
and step 17 here?

2010
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:09,479
Yeah,

2011
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,450
what don't you like?

2012
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,390
Because then it would check each and every condition,

2013
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:13,680
um,

2014
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,919
even though for example the first one might be fulfilled,

2015
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,720
it would check the 2nd and 3rd to that way.

2016
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:20,419
Exactly,

2017
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:23,270
it's another example of bad design because now no matter

2018
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,299
what you were asking three questions on lines 9,

2019
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,060
13,

2020
01:13:27,109 --> 01:13:27,939
and 17.

2021
01:13:27,959 --> 01:13:31,729
Even if X ends up being less than Y from the get-go,

2022
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:33,890
you're still wasting everyone's time by saying,

2023
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:34,029
well,

2024
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:34,410
well,

2025
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,509
is X greater than Y?

2026
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,209
You already might know that it's not.

2027
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:38,270
Is X equal to Y?

2028
01:13:38,299 --> 01:13:40,049
You already might know that it's not.

2029
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:44,689
And so these three conditionals at the moment are mutually exclusive,

2030
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:47,970
whereby you're checking all three of them no matter what,

2031
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,259
even though logically that should.

2032
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:50,351
Be necessary.

2033
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,000
So our first approach was actually quite better.

2034
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,871
And in fact just to show you the density difference here,

2035
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,110
let me go back to this very first version here

2036
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,641
whereby I was only checking that one condition is X less than y.

2037
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,041
Well,

2038
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,630
if you're more of a visual learner,

2039
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:08,041
you can actually draw out what code looks like in flow chart form.

2040
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:13,541
So here is a drawing of a program that starts here and ideally stops down here,

2041
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,761
and each of these figures in the middle

2042
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:18,451
sort of represent logical components of the code.

2043
01:14:18,762 --> 01:14:19,102
Uh,

2044
01:14:19,182 --> 01:14:23,012
here in the in the diamond here is my boolean expression,

2045
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:24,512
which represents the start of the conditional.

2046
01:14:24,582 --> 01:14:26,012
So if X is less than Y,

2047
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:27,372
I have a decision to make.

2048
01:14:27,432 --> 01:14:28,222
Yes or no,

2049
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,242
true or false.

2050
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:29,501
Well,

2051
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,981
if it is less than Y,

2052
01:14:31,461 --> 01:14:31,932
true,

2053
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:32,222
well,

2054
01:14:32,282 --> 01:14:34,791
let's go ahead and print out quote unquote X is less than Y

2055
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:35,972
and then stop.

2056
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:36,582
However,

2057
01:14:36,662 --> 01:14:39,812
the first version of that program recall just said nothing

2058
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:42,972
if it were not the case that X were less than Y.

2059
01:14:43,182 --> 01:14:46,222
That's because false just led to the stop of the program.

2060
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:47,452
There's no keyword stop.

2061
01:14:47,622 --> 01:14:48,021
There's just.

2062
01:14:48,132 --> 01:14:50,792
No no code to handle that situation,

2063
01:14:51,002 --> 01:14:52,393
but the second version of the code,

2064
01:14:52,522 --> 01:14:55,752
when I actually added in ES looked fundamentally a little different.

2065
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:56,752
So now

2066
01:14:57,323 --> 01:15:00,522
2nd version of that code asked is X less than Y and if true,

2067
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:02,152
behavior is exactly the same.

2068
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:03,473
But if it weren't true,

2069
01:15:03,553 --> 01:15:04,703
it were instead false,

2070
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:07,652
that's when I got the message X is not less than Y.

2071
01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:12,152
But in the third version of the code where I added the if else if L if,

2072
01:15:12,362 --> 01:15:15,873
then the picture gets a little more complicated and let me zoom in top to bottom.

2073
01:15:16,362 --> 01:15:17,192
Here we have.

2074
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:18,744
Longer flow chart,

2075
01:15:18,983 --> 01:15:20,423
but the questions are really the same.

2076
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,894
When I start this program,

2077
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:22,463
I ask,

2078
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:24,583
is is X less than Y?

2079
01:15:24,744 --> 01:15:25,324
If so,

2080
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,994
I print out X is less than Y.

2081
01:15:28,344 --> 01:15:28,733
However,

2082
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:29,264
in that,

2083
01:15:29,664 --> 01:15:30,943
in that last version of the program,

2084
01:15:31,023 --> 01:15:33,653
I was still foolishly asking the same question.

2085
01:15:33,903 --> 01:15:33,943
Well,

2086
01:15:34,023 --> 01:15:34,374
wait a minute,

2087
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:35,474
is X greater than Y?

2088
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:36,344
Wait a minute,

2089
01:15:36,383 --> 01:15:37,653
is X equal toy?

2090
01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:41,583
And that's the version in which again I had all of that unnecessary

2091
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:46,094
code which I just undeleted here asking three questions at a time.

2092
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:46,833
Ideally,

2093
01:15:46,895 --> 01:15:50,274
Don't want to make that mistake by doing it again and again and again.

2094
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,555
So if I instead revert that code

2095
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:53,685
to ETS

2096
01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:55,104
if

2097
01:15:55,444 --> 01:15:56,834
and Es if,

2098
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:59,285
then my flow chart looks a little bit

2099
01:15:59,285 --> 01:16:01,924
different because notice the sort of shortcuts now.

2100
01:16:02,044 --> 01:16:03,274
If X is less than Y,

2101
01:16:03,915 --> 01:16:04,084
woo,

2102
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:04,604
true,

2103
01:16:04,714 --> 01:16:06,754
we do this and we're done super quick.

2104
01:16:07,004 --> 01:16:08,285
If x is not less than Y,

2105
01:16:08,365 --> 01:16:08,654
fine,

2106
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:09,845
we do ask one more question.

2107
01:16:09,854 --> 01:16:10,895
X is greater than Y.

2108
01:16:11,205 --> 01:16:11,285
Well,

2109
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:11,875
if so,

2110
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:12,404
boom,

2111
01:16:12,595 --> 01:16:16,165
we make our way to the end of the program by just printing that only if it's the.

2112
01:16:16,275 --> 01:16:18,416
Reverse case where x equals equals y.

2113
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:19,815
Do we check this condition?

2114
01:16:19,945 --> 01:16:20,295
No.

2115
01:16:20,425 --> 01:16:21,065
This condition,

2116
01:16:21,105 --> 01:16:21,456
no.

2117
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,335
This condition and then OK,

2118
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:27,425
now we can print out X is equal toy because it must be logically.

2119
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:29,255
Of course it's been observed multiple times.

2120
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:30,945
This is a waste of everyone's time,

2121
01:16:30,985 --> 01:16:34,295
so we can prune this chart more and just have one question,

2122
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:35,536
two questions,

2123
01:16:35,786 --> 01:16:38,145
and that alone tightens up the program.

2124
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:38,456
So again,

2125
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:39,625
if you're more of a visual learner,

2126
01:16:39,826 --> 01:16:43,815
most any block of code you can translate to this sort of pictorial form,

2127
01:16:44,025 --> 01:16:45,505
but it really just captures the same.

2128
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,709
Logical flow that the indentation and the syntax in the code itself

2129
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,069
is meant to

2130
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,350
imply.

2131
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:54,379
All right,

2132
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,779
how about a final exercise with one other type here?

2133
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:00,689
Recall that this is our available types to us.

2134
01:17:00,859 --> 01:17:03,810
Actually two final examples here before we have a bit of a break.

2135
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,399
Here we have a list of types that we can use,

2136
01:17:06,419 --> 01:17:08,810
and here we have a list of functions that we can use.

2137
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:11,100
Let's go ahead and make a program that's

2138
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,439
representative of something we do quite often nowadays,

2139
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,540
but using a different type.

2140
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,979
So let me go back into VS code.

2141
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,819
Let me close compare.c.

2142
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:21,689
Let me reopen my terminal window and clear it just so we have a new prompt.

2143
01:17:21,819 --> 01:17:23,189
And let's go ahead and create a program.

2144
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,379
Called agree.c.

2145
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,549
It's all too often nowadays that we have to like agree to terms and conditions.

2146
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,000
To be fair,

2147
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,520
it's usually in the form of like a pop up and a button that we click,

2148
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,310
but we can do this in code at the command line as well.

2149
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,509
Let me go ahead and include to start CS 50.H and include to start standardio.h.

2150
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,379
Let me again for today's purposes do in Main void,

2151
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:44,250
but we'll reveal next week what we why we keep doing that.

2152
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:46,020
And now for a yes no answer,

2153
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,350
it suffices just to ask for a single char or character,

2154
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,470
not a whole string.

2155
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,229
So let's do this char.

2156
01:17:53,029 --> 01:17:56,410
C equals get char and let's ask the user,

2157
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,180
quote unquote,

2158
01:17:57,299 --> 01:18:00,129
do you agree question mark for instance.

2159
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,009
And now

2160
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,870
I can actually compare that value for

2161
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,649
quality with some known answers.

2162
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,060
For instance,

2163
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,770
I could say if C equals equalsy,

2164
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,129
then go ahead and print out,

2165
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:13,850
for instance,

2166
01:18:14,259 --> 01:18:17,759
agreed period backslash semicolon,

2167
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,979
else if C equals equals n.

2168
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:22,939
In quotes,

2169
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,089
let's go ahead and print out,

2170
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:24,629
for instance,

2171
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,660
not agreed backslash and

2172
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,009
semicolon.

2173
01:18:28,299 --> 01:18:30,290
Now there's still room for improvement here,

2174
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:34,120
but notice we're just now using the same building blocks and C

2175
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:36,779
um in different ways to solve different problems.

2176
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:39,000
But notice on lines 8 and 12

2177
01:18:39,259 --> 01:18:40,419
I've used single quotes,

2178
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,850
which I alluded to earlier.

2179
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:43,529
Why

2180
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,410
is that the case?

2181
01:18:45,979 --> 01:18:47,339
Why single in this case here?

2182
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:49,120
Yeah,

2183
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,069
it's a single character and this is just the way you do it in C.

2184
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,830
When you want to compare a single character,

2185
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,560
you use chars and you use single quotes.

2186
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,200
When you want to use strings of text like multiple characters,

2187
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,040
multiple words,

2188
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,640
multiple sentences or paragraphs,

2189
01:19:02,759 --> 01:19:03,959
you use strings.

2190
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:04,549
So

2191
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:05,830
this would seem to work,

2192
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:06,279
but are.

2193
01:19:06,395 --> 01:19:10,254
I could be a little more efficient if the user doesn't type Y.

2194
01:19:10,464 --> 01:19:10,665
I mean,

2195
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:11,024
frankly,

2196
01:19:11,064 --> 01:19:13,544
I could just chop off this L if and make it an

2197
01:19:13,814 --> 01:19:16,015
E and just assume if you don't give me ay answer,

2198
01:19:16,225 --> 01:19:19,535
then at least I'm going to assume the worst and you don't agree.

2199
01:19:19,705 --> 01:19:20,334
But even here,

2200
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:21,884
the program's not all that great.

2201
01:19:22,064 --> 01:19:23,665
Let me go ahead and do make agree.

2202
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:25,609
And then do slash agree,

2203
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,419
and do I agree?

2204
01:19:26,549 --> 01:19:26,839
Sure,

2205
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,299
I'm gonna go ahead and type Y.

2206
01:19:28,549 --> 01:19:28,959
Meanwhile,

2207
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:30,919
if I type anything else like N

2208
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:33,729
or uh even emphatically no,

2209
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:34,939
that would seem to,

2210
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:35,350
whoops,

2211
01:19:35,589 --> 01:19:36,629
why did that not work?

2212
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,299
Yeah.

2213
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:39,609
Exactly.

2214
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:44,310
So among the features of CS 50's functions like Getchar is

2215
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:47,180
that it will enforce what type of data you're getting.

2216
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,430
So even though I,

2217
01:19:48,669 --> 01:19:49,750
because I use Getchar,

2218
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:53,549
if the user doesn't cooperate and types in multiple characters,

2219
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:54,439
GetAR,

2220
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:55,669
like some of our other functions,

2221
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,149
is just designed to prompt them again.

2222
01:19:57,484 --> 01:19:59,595
Again and again until they cooperate,

2223
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:03,084
that's useful so that you don't have to deal with that kind of error checking.

2224
01:20:03,285 --> 01:20:05,435
But here I could type N in uppercase,

2225
01:20:05,674 --> 01:20:09,165
and that seems to now work but that only works because of the Ls.

2226
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:10,125
Let me go ahead and do this,

2227
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,314
which is very reasonable.

2228
01:20:11,564 --> 01:20:13,004
I'm going to go ahead and type Y

2229
01:20:13,365 --> 01:20:13,604
Y,

2230
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:14,884
which you would hope works.

2231
01:20:15,339 --> 01:20:17,169
That feels like a bug at this point.

2232
01:20:17,299 --> 01:20:19,419
Like it's fine if we don't want to support yes and no.

2233
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:20,919
We just want to support Y and N,

2234
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,379
but it's kind of obnoxious not to support the upper case version thereof.

2235
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,580
So how can we fix this?

2236
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:25,740
Well,

2237
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,700
let me hide my terminal window and I could go in and fix this as follows.

2238
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:29,250
I can say,

2239
01:20:29,339 --> 01:20:29,459
well,

2240
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,500
else if C equals equals quote unquote.

2241
01:20:31,935 --> 01:20:32,975
Capital Y

2242
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:38,274
in single quotes and then I can do print out agreed period backslash and semicolon,

2243
01:20:38,285 --> 01:20:38,975
and then I can do

2244
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:40,435
that

2245
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,694
that would work that would work there,

2246
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,875
but what rubs you the wrong way perhaps about this solution,

2247
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:47,865
even if you've never programmed before.

2248
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,859
Just applying some of the lessons from last week,

2249
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:51,359
yeah.

2250
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:53,589
It's redundant.

2251
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,830
I mean,

2252
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:55,500
I didn't technically copy and paste,

2253
01:20:55,509 --> 01:20:57,990
but like line 14 is identical to the line 10,

2254
01:20:58,029 --> 01:20:59,410
so I might as well have copied and paste,

2255
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:00,870
and that's generally bad practice.

2256
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:01,419
Why?

2257
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:01,669
Well,

2258
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:04,839
if I want to change the English language to say something else in that case,

2259
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:07,700
now I have to change it twice and it's just I'm repeating myself,

2260
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:09,189
which is just bad design.

2261
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,850
So there are ways to address this through other

2262
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:13,680
types of operators that we haven't yet seen.

2263
01:21:13,729 --> 01:21:15,450
If I want to ask two questions at once,

2264
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:16,160
that's fine.

2265
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:17,680
I can do something like this.

2266
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:17,890
Well,

2267
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,990
if C equals equals Y

2268
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:22,850
or C equals equals Y,

2269
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:29,229
I can tighten things up using so-called logical operators whereby I am now

2270
01:21:29,229 --> 01:21:31,509
taking a boolean expression and composing

2271
01:21:31,509 --> 01:21:33,740
it from two smaller boolean expressions,

2272
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:38,299
and I care about the answer to one of those questions being true.

2273
01:21:38,549 --> 01:21:42,100
So whether it's lowercase y or uppercasey,

2274
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:45,020
this code now will work and if it's anything else,

2275
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:47,189
we're going to default to not agreed.

2276
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,640
So the two vertical bars,

2277
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,549
which is probably not a character you type that often,

2278
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,279
and it varies where it is on your keyboard

2279
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:55,549
depending whether it's American English or something else,

2280
01:21:55,759 --> 01:21:57,250
just means logical or.

2281
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,870
This is not relevant here,

2282
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,350
but you could also in some contexts use two ampersands to connote and,

2283
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,580
but this does not make sense why.

2284
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,549
Why is it clearly not correct to say and in between these two clauses,

2285
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:11,799
yeah.

2286
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:15,500
Exactly,

2287
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,859
the variable can't both be lower case and uppercase.

2288
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,100
That just makes no sense.

2289
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,089
So this would be a bug,

2290
01:22:20,259 --> 01:22:24,410
but using a vertical two vertical bars here is in fact correct.

2291
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:24,859
All right,

2292
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:25,009
well,

2293
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,379
let's do one final flourish here besides conditionals.

2294
01:22:28,419 --> 01:22:29,540
We had these now loops.

2295
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:32,589
We call that a loop is just something that does something again and again and again.

2296
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:32,990
Here,

2297
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:33,390
for instance,

2298
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:35,770
to scratch how we might meow 3 times.

2299
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,810
In C

2300
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,270
there's going to be a few different ways to do this.

2301
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,370
Here is one.

2302
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,580
You can in C.

2303
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:44,750
Declare a variable like I for integer or whatever you

2304
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,500
want to call it and set it equal to 3,

2305
01:22:46,549 --> 01:22:47,700
the number you care about.

2306
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,140
You can then use a loop,

2307
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:52,390
and the closest to the repeat block is arguably a y loop.

2308
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:54,120
There is no repeat keyword in C,

2309
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,770
so we can't translate this verbatim,

2310
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:57,660
but we could say while

2311
01:22:58,069 --> 01:22:59,390
I is greater than 0.

2312
01:22:59,549 --> 01:22:59,899
Why?

2313
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,509
Because that's sort of logically what I want to do.

2314
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,819
If I start counting at 3,

2315
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:06,060
maybe I can just sort of decrement one at a time and get down to 0,

2316
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:06,939
at which point

2317
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:09,020
I can stop doing this thing.

2318
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,217
So I'm going to initialize a variable to I,

2319
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:12,848
a variable I to 3,

2320
01:23:12,948 --> 01:23:15,547
and then I'm going to say while I is greater than 0,

2321
01:23:15,587 --> 01:23:16,917
go ahead and do the following.

2322
01:23:16,987 --> 01:23:20,857
And at the end of that loop before whipping around again,

2323
01:23:21,067 --> 01:23:22,388
I'm going to use this line of code,

2324
01:23:22,467 --> 01:23:23,187
which we haven't seen,

2325
01:23:23,228 --> 01:23:24,098
but you can infer

2326
01:23:24,308 --> 01:23:27,417
I minus minus just means subtract 1 from I.

2327
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:29,587
So this is going to have the effect of starting at 3,

2328
01:23:29,748 --> 01:23:30,507
going to 2,

2329
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:31,518
going to 1,

2330
01:23:31,748 --> 01:23:32,458
going to 0,

2331
01:23:32,467 --> 01:23:33,667
and as soon as it goes to 0,

2332
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:34,937
this boolean expression

2333
01:23:35,187 --> 01:23:36,428
will no longer be true.

2334
01:23:36,516 --> 01:23:39,136
And so the loop will just implicitly stop

2335
01:23:39,346 --> 01:23:40,096
because that's it.

2336
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:43,976
So what are we going to put inside of the curly braces besides this decrementation?

2337
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:44,346
Well,

2338
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,855
I think I can get away with just saying meow,

2339
01:23:47,145 --> 01:23:50,735
and that will now print 123 times.

2340
01:23:50,945 --> 01:23:51,826
And yet that's interesting.

2341
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:54,576
I sort of counted instinctively 123,

2342
01:23:54,746 --> 01:23:57,596
even though I'm proposing that we count 321.

2343
01:23:57,826 --> 01:24:00,565
So can we implement the logic in the other direction whereby

2344
01:24:00,565 --> 01:24:02,866
we count up from 0 instead of down from 3?

2345
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:02,985
Well,

2346
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:03,226
sure,

2347
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:03,746
we just have to.

2348
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:04,583
A few changes.

2349
01:24:04,624 --> 01:24:07,253
We can set i equal to 0 initially.

2350
01:24:07,503 --> 01:24:11,633
We can change our boolean expression to check that I is less than 3

2351
01:24:11,943 --> 01:24:12,213
again,

2352
01:24:12,324 --> 01:24:12,914
again and again.

2353
01:24:12,943 --> 01:24:14,313
And on each iteration of this loop,

2354
01:24:14,423 --> 01:24:17,293
let's just keep incrementing I with I plus plus.

2355
01:24:17,423 --> 01:24:22,534
And at this point it will have the effect of doing +1233 is not less than 3,

2356
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,293
so I won't put any more fingers up.

2357
01:24:24,503 --> 01:24:27,613
I will meow in total 3 total times.

2358
01:24:27,784 --> 01:24:28,104
And again,

2359
01:24:28,144 --> 01:24:29,144
if you're a visual person,

2360
01:24:29,224 --> 01:24:31,023
here's how we might start counting at 0.

2361
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:31,892
Initially,

2362
01:24:32,142 --> 01:24:33,651
check that i is less than 3,

2363
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:34,812
which it is initially,

2364
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:35,832
and if so,

2365
01:24:35,941 --> 01:24:36,782
we print out meow.

2366
01:24:37,102 --> 01:24:39,731
Then we increment I and we get whisked around again

2367
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:42,412
to the Boolean expression because that's how while loops work.

2368
01:24:42,582 --> 01:24:46,301
You constantly have the condition being checked again and again.

2369
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:47,771
That's just how C works.

2370
01:24:47,901 --> 01:24:54,361
As soon as I've incremented I from 0 to 1 to 2 to 33 will eventually not equal,

2371
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:55,611
not be less than 3,

2372
01:24:55,622 --> 01:24:56,892
so the answer will be false,

2373
01:24:57,182 --> 01:24:58,341
so the loop will just.

2374
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,850
So that has the effect of achieving the same,

2375
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,580
but it turns out that looping some amount of times is so

2376
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:07,180
darn common that you don't strictly have to use a Y loop.

2377
01:25:07,419 --> 01:25:08,180
A 4 loop,

2378
01:25:08,299 --> 01:25:08,770
so to speak,

2379
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:10,580
is another alternative there too,

2380
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,529
whereby the syntax is a little weird,

2381
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,879
it's a little harder to memorize,

2382
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,220
but it allows you to write slightly less code

2383
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,290
because you write more code on a single line.

2384
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:21,399
So the way you read a for loop is exactly the same in spirit.

2385
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,970
You initialize the variable,

2386
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,660
everything to the left of this first semicolon.

2387
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,049
You then

2388
01:25:27,299 --> 01:25:29,580
check the condition and the computer does all this for you.

2389
01:25:29,609 --> 01:25:30,819
If I less than 3,

2390
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:31,410
if so,

2391
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,689
you execute what's inside of the curly braces,

2392
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:34,890
and then automatically

2393
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,479
the thing to the right of the second semicolon happens,

2394
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:40,890
so I gets incremented from 0 to 1 in this case.

2395
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,990
The condition is checked is 1 less than 3.

2396
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:43,450
It is,

2397
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:44,740
so we print meow again.

2398
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,839
And C increments 1 to 2.

2399
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:49,040
Is 2 less than 3?

2400
01:25:49,049 --> 01:25:49,250
Yes.

2401
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,640
So we now again

2402
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:52,490
I gets incremented to 3.

2403
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:53,729
Is 3 less than 3?

2404
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:54,279
No,

2405
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:55,569
so the 4 loops stops.

2406
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,000
So it's exactly the same,

2407
01:25:57,169 --> 01:25:58,950
but just more magic is happening

2408
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:03,240
in this first line of code here more than you yourselves have to actually write,

2409
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,240
and it's just arguably more common convention,

2410
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,089
but both of them.

2411
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,649
Are perfectly correct if you'd like to do that yourself.

2412
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:14,069
So let's go ahead and actually implement now this this beginning of a CAT in VS code.

2413
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,640
Let me go back to VS code and close agree.c.

2414
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:21,310
Let me reopen my terminal window and create an actual cat in cat.C.

2415
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:23,479
And let's go ahead and do this initially the wrong way,

2416
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,279
include standardio.

2417
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,120
H in main void,

2418
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,359
and then inside of Main,

2419
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:32,959
let's go ahead and print out quote unquote meow backslash N semicolon.

2420
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:33,779
And then heck,

2421
01:26:33,859 --> 01:26:35,020
let me just copy paste.

2422
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,779
So this is obviously the wrong way,

2423
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,689
the bad way to do this because I'm literally copying and pasting,

2424
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:42,209
but it is correct if I want the cat to meow 3 times,

2425
01:26:42,379 --> 01:26:43,569
I can make this cat.

2426
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,310
I can do cat,

2427
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:46,819
and I get my meow,

2428
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:47,339
meow,

2429
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:47,870
meow.

2430
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,620
But let's now actually use some of those

2431
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,140
new building blocks whereby we converted scratch to.

2432
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,600
See and let me go back into this code and I'll do the while loop first.

2433
01:26:55,689 --> 01:27:00,959
So I could instead have done in i equals 3 if we count down initially

2434
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:03,600
while I is greater than 0,

2435
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:04,720
then go ahead

2436
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:08,959
and print out quote unquote meow backslash N and then

2437
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:11,129
do I + plus or I minus.

2438
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:16,200
I minus minus because we're starting at 3.

2439
01:27:16,529 --> 01:27:18,759
Now let me go back to my terminal window and clear it.

2440
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:25,160
Do makecagalaca and we get 3 meows and this is now arguably better implemented.

2441
01:27:25,299 --> 01:27:27,270
What if I want to flip things around?

2442
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:28,040
Well,

2443
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:29,640
I could now change,

2444
01:27:29,899 --> 01:27:30,160
uh,

2445
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:32,020
maybe do it the normal person way.

2446
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:33,674
I could start counting at 0,

2447
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:37,084
and I can do this so long as I is less than 3,

2448
01:27:37,104 --> 01:27:41,504
and I can do this so long as I increment I on each iteration.

2449
01:27:41,765 --> 01:27:45,225
Now I can do makecagaincat enter,

2450
01:27:45,435 --> 01:27:46,504
and that too works.

2451
01:27:46,555 --> 01:27:49,424
But there's another way I could do this if I want to count like a normal person,

2452
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:50,924
like start counting from 1

2453
01:27:51,234 --> 01:27:54,194
and count up 2 and through 3.

2454
01:27:54,779 --> 01:27:55,930
I could do this,

2455
01:27:56,089 --> 01:27:57,799
but this is arguably this is correct.

2456
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:59,490
It would iterate 3 times,

2457
01:27:59,529 --> 01:28:01,009
but it's a little confusing because now I have to

2458
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,560
think about what it means to be less than 4.

2459
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:02,810
OK,

2460
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:03,919
that means equal to 3.

2461
01:28:04,049 --> 01:28:05,520
I could be a little more explicit and say,

2462
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:07,890
we'll do this while I is less than or equal

2463
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,410
to 3 using yet another one of those operators.

2464
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:11,890
So I can make a cat yet again,

2465
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:14,129
and that too would work.

2466
01:28:14,209 --> 01:28:16,370
Now which of these is correct or best?

2467
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,240
The convention truthfully is in general in code to start counting from zero,

2468
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:24,330
start counting up to but not through the value.

2469
01:28:24,515 --> 01:28:26,424
You that you want so at least you see

2470
01:28:26,424 --> 01:28:29,334
the starting point and the ending point on the screen

2471
01:28:29,544 --> 01:28:31,214
if you will at the same time.

2472
01:28:31,424 --> 01:28:34,055
But of course I can condense all of this a bit more and turn this whole

2473
01:28:34,055 --> 01:28:37,995
thing into a 4 loop and I instead could do 4 in I equals 0,

2474
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:39,024
I less than 3,

2475
01:28:39,104 --> 01:28:39,865
I + plus,

2476
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:40,854
and then down here

2477
01:28:41,064 --> 01:28:42,754
I could do print out quote unquote meow

2478
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:43,634
and

2479
01:28:43,904 --> 01:28:46,495
if only because I typed fewer keystrokes that time,

2480
01:28:46,544 --> 01:28:47,745
like this feels a little nicer,

2481
01:28:47,805 --> 01:28:48,774
it's a little tighter

2482
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:52,615
and more efficient to create even though the effect is the same.

2483
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:53,064
Indeed,

2484
01:28:53,104 --> 01:28:54,104
when I make this cat.

2485
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:57,689
And do a final time this year to

2486
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,049
gives me the three meows.

2487
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:01,399
So what

2488
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:02,640
could go wrong?

2489
01:29:02,729 --> 01:29:02,890
Well,

2490
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:05,549
sometimes you might be inclined to do something forever,

2491
01:29:05,609 --> 01:29:06,959
and we might have done that in scratch,

2492
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,770
and indeed we did when we had some things bouncing

2493
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:10,560
back and forth off of walls and so forth.

2494
01:29:10,689 --> 01:29:12,040
You can achieve the same thing in code.

2495
01:29:12,129 --> 01:29:12,370
In fact,

2496
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:14,439
in C we could use a while loop,

2497
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,089
but there is no forever block,

2498
01:29:16,129 --> 01:29:17,529
so while suffices.

2499
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:20,799
But recall that the while loop expects a boolean expression,

2500
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:21,700
and if I want to do something.

2501
01:29:21,755 --> 01:29:24,576
Forever I essentially need an expression here that's always true.

2502
01:29:24,746 --> 01:29:28,625
So I could do something stupid and arbitrary like while 2

2503
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:32,145
is greater than 3 or while 1 is less than 2.

2504
01:29:32,186 --> 01:29:32,346
I mean,

2505
01:29:32,465 --> 01:29:36,655
make a statement of fact that never changes ergo it's just going to run forever.

2506
01:29:36,826 --> 01:29:38,425
But if the whole goal here is to do something

2507
01:29:38,425 --> 01:29:41,016
forever and to get this boolean expression to be true,

2508
01:29:41,226 --> 01:29:44,335
the convention in programming is just to literally say while true,

2509
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:45,465
and that implies.

2510
01:29:45,602 --> 01:29:49,671
And functionally means that you will do this thing forever

2511
01:29:49,671 --> 01:29:53,032
unless you somehow prematurely break out of those curly braces.

2512
01:29:53,111 --> 01:29:54,582
More on that before long.

2513
01:29:54,791 --> 01:29:56,341
So if I want to meow forever,

2514
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:58,142
I could now just do this,

2515
01:29:58,231 --> 01:30:00,301
and this would be an infinite deliberate loop,

2516
01:30:00,591 --> 01:30:02,392
but unlike a game where you might want it to

2517
01:30:02,392 --> 01:30:04,151
keep going and going and going for some time,

2518
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:05,421
I'm not sure this is going to

2519
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:06,791
be the best thing for us.

2520
01:30:06,872 --> 01:30:07,832
Let's go ahead and try this.

2521
01:30:07,912 --> 01:30:09,412
So let me go ahead here and

2522
01:30:09,799 --> 01:30:11,089
Include for good measure

2523
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:13,689
uh CS 50's library if only because

2524
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:17,689
um it too is giving us features like uh bulls.

2525
01:30:17,899 --> 01:30:18,129
Uh,

2526
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,720
here I'm gonna go ahead and say while true,

2527
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:23,970
and then inside of my curly braces I'm just gonna print out meow.

2528
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:27,419
Let's go ahead backslash N semicolon.

2529
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:30,390
Let's go ahead here and make cat

2530
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,850
one final time.

2531
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,100
Let me go ahead here and do cat and.

2532
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:41,250
This is like the annoying cat game just like meowing meowing meowing endlessly.

2533
01:30:41,339 --> 01:30:44,339
Like I've now kind of lost control over my terminal window and mark my words,

2534
01:30:44,379 --> 01:30:45,689
at some point you might do this too,

2535
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:48,330
but let's go ahead and take a juicy 10 minute break here.

2536
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:48,720
Uh,

2537
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:51,339
we have some delicious blueberry muffins out in the transep.

2538
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:52,169
Come back in 10,

2539
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:53,819
and we'll figure out how to stop this here,

2540
01:30:53,859 --> 01:30:54,100
cat.

2541
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:55,410
Alright,

2542
01:30:57,109 --> 01:31:00,189
so it's been about 10 minutes and like VS code

2543
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:03,580
is freaking out with high code space CPU utilization detected.

2544
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,669
Consider stopping some processes for the best experience.

2545
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:10,540
So this is what happens when you have intentionally or otherwise an infinite loop

2546
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:13,500
insofar as I've been printing out meow endlessly,

2547
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:16,910
and I was warned by my colleague that I probably shouldn't let this run too.

2548
01:31:17,029 --> 01:31:20,020
Long because we might lose control over the environment altogether,

2549
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:21,029
but the answer

2550
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,939
to how to solve this is going to be control C.

2551
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,140
So there's a few cryptic keystrokes that you can

2552
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,490
use to generally interrupt things as in this way.

2553
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:29,009
And in fact,

2554
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,339
if I go back and you'll see,

2555
01:31:30,379 --> 01:31:30,500
you know,

2556
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,850
I kind of lost control over my code space here,

2557
01:31:32,979 --> 01:31:35,609
I'm going to go ahead and try to reload the window altogether,

2558
01:31:35,859 --> 01:31:38,720
but had I hit control C in time,

2559
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:41,740
let's hope this doesn't now go off the rails.

2560
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,250
Control C

2561
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:44,180
would have been

2562
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:45,419
our friend.

2563
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:46,580
There we go,

2564
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:47,540
and we're back.

2565
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:48,259
OK,

2566
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:51,589
so now that we've got control over our so-called code space again,

2567
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:55,430
how can we go about making our meowing program a little more dynamic in so far

2568
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:58,720
as let's like start asking the user how many times they want the cat to meow,

2569
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,950
certainly rather than do it an infinite number of times

2570
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:03,779
and even rather than do it 3 times alone.

2571
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:04,790
I think we have all.

2572
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:06,461
These building blocks thus far.

2573
01:32:06,532 --> 01:32:08,691
So let me go ahead and stay in cat.c here and go

2574
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:11,771
ahead and delete the body of the contents of my main function.

2575
01:32:11,881 --> 01:32:12,841
And let's go ahead and do this.

2576
01:32:12,972 --> 01:32:15,981
Let's give myself an in and I'll go ahead and call it N for number,

2577
01:32:16,251 --> 01:32:18,481
though I could be more verbose than that if I wanted.

2578
01:32:18,651 --> 01:32:22,102
I'm going to set it equal to the so-called return value of get in,

2579
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:24,972
which we call is going to get an integer from the user and quote unquote,

2580
01:32:25,051 --> 01:32:27,372
let's ask the user what's and just.

2581
01:32:27,523 --> 01:32:28,403
Like I asked earlier,

2582
01:32:28,474 --> 01:32:29,883
what's X and what's Y,

2583
01:32:30,034 --> 01:32:32,344
where N is the number of times I want the cat to meow.

2584
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:33,974
Now how can I use this variable?

2585
01:32:34,043 --> 01:32:34,173
Well,

2586
01:32:34,193 --> 01:32:35,423
we have that building block too.

2587
01:32:35,474 --> 01:32:37,333
I could use a Y loop or a 4 loop,

2588
01:32:37,474 --> 01:32:39,054
and if I use a 4 loop,

2589
01:32:39,113 --> 01:32:40,023
I could do this.

2590
01:32:40,313 --> 01:32:42,903
I could initialize a variable I for integer,

2591
01:32:43,153 --> 01:32:44,784
set it equal to 0 initially.

2592
01:32:44,954 --> 01:32:47,824
I could then do I less than not 3 this time,

2593
01:32:48,153 --> 01:32:48,744
but N,

2594
01:32:49,034 --> 01:32:49,994
so I can use that.

2595
01:32:50,235 --> 01:32:53,375
Variable is a placeholder inside of the loop to indicate that

2596
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:55,965
I want to do this n times instead of 3,

2597
01:32:56,045 --> 01:32:58,485
and on each iteration through this loop I can do I + plus.

2598
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:02,136
Of course I could be counting down if I prefer by using decrementation,

2599
01:33:02,175 --> 01:33:03,905
but logically I would say this is canonical.

2600
01:33:04,016 --> 01:33:05,666
Start at 0 and go up 2,

2601
01:33:05,775 --> 01:33:08,565
but not through the value that you actually care about.

2602
01:33:08,735 --> 01:33:12,666
And I'll go ahead now and print out quote unquote meow with a backslash N semicolon.

2603
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,319
Back down to my terminal,

2604
01:33:14,509 --> 01:33:15,450
make this catgaca enter.

2605
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,560
I'm prompted this time for N.

2606
01:33:18,649 --> 01:33:20,279
I can still give it 3,

2607
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:22,120
and I'm going to get 3 meows this time.

2608
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:22,450
However,

2609
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:27,040
if I run it again with cat and a different input like 4,

2610
01:33:27,209 --> 01:33:30,029
of course I'm going to get 4 meows instead.

2611
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:31,879
Now what is get in doing for me?

2612
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:32,009
Well,

2613
01:33:32,049 --> 01:33:35,330
it does a few things similar to get char doing a few things for me.

2614
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:36,160
For instance,

2615
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,169
suppose that instead of answering this question correctly with a number.

2616
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:40,280
and

2617
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,590
I say something random like dog

2618
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,931
that is not an integer and so the get in function is

2619
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:51,070
designed to reject the user's input implicitly and just reprompt again,

2620
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,511
again and again.

2621
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,871
I can try bird and it's going to do this again.

2622
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,000
So somewhere in the implementation of get in there's a loop that

2623
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,431
we wrote that does this kind of error checking for you,

2624
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:03,840
but it doesn't do everything because an integer

2625
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,300
is a fairly broad category of numbers.

2626
01:34:06,311 --> 01:34:07,480
It's like negative infinity.

2627
01:34:07,562 --> 01:34:10,392
Through positive infinity and that's a lot of possibilities,

2628
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,671
but suppose I don't want some of those possibilities.

2629
01:34:12,762 --> 01:34:17,671
Suppose that it makes no sense to ask the cat to meow like -1 time,

2630
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:19,501
and yet the program accepts that.

2631
01:34:19,551 --> 01:34:22,301
It doesn't do anything or anything wrong,

2632
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:24,602
but I feel like a better designed program would say no,

2633
01:34:24,631 --> 01:34:24,791
no,

2634
01:34:24,872 --> 01:34:24,952
no,

2635
01:34:25,111 --> 01:34:26,751
like -1 makes no sense.

2636
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,501
Let's meow 0 or 1 or 2 or more times instead.

2637
01:34:30,711 --> 01:34:34,791
So how can I begin to add some of my own error checking and coerce the user.

2638
01:34:34,873 --> 01:34:36,583
To give me the type of input I want.

2639
01:34:36,942 --> 01:34:37,022
Well,

2640
01:34:37,062 --> 01:34:39,333
let me clear my terminal window and go back up into my code,

2641
01:34:39,462 --> 01:34:40,982
and why don't I do something like this?

2642
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:42,132
After getting N,

2643
01:34:42,663 --> 01:34:43,732
let's just check

2644
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:46,422
if N is less than 0,

2645
01:34:46,663 --> 01:34:47,382
because if so,

2646
01:34:47,422 --> 01:34:49,292
I want to prompt the user again,

2647
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:55,053
and I can prompt the user again by doing N equals get in quote unquote what's

2648
01:34:55,382 --> 01:34:57,812
N question mark semicolon.

2649
01:34:58,062 --> 01:34:59,263
Now what's going on here?

2650
01:34:59,382 --> 01:34:59,462
Well,

2651
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:02,103
on line 6 I'm doing two things.

2652
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:04,883
I'm getting an integer from the user and

2653
01:35:05,133 --> 01:35:07,844
I'm not only storing it in the variable N,

2654
01:35:08,213 --> 01:35:10,414
I'm also technically creating the variable N.

2655
01:35:10,534 --> 01:35:11,693
So I didn't call this out earlier,

2656
01:35:11,733 --> 01:35:15,534
but on line 6 when you specify the type of a variable and the name of the variable,

2657
01:35:15,693 --> 01:35:19,374
you are creating the variable somewhere in the computer's memory,

2658
01:35:19,394 --> 01:35:20,733
and that's necessary in C

2659
01:35:20,894 --> 01:35:22,284
to specify the type.

2660
01:35:22,693 --> 01:35:24,374
If the variable already exists though,

2661
01:35:24,574 --> 01:35:27,784
and you just want to reuse it and change it later on,

2662
01:35:27,974 --> 01:35:29,414
it suffices as in line.

2663
01:35:29,555 --> 01:35:31,595
9 just to reference it by name.

2664
01:35:31,685 --> 01:35:35,524
It would be sort of stupid to specify the type again because C already knows

2665
01:35:35,524 --> 01:35:38,955
what type it is because you told C what it is on line 6.

2666
01:35:39,165 --> 01:35:42,555
So that's why line 6 and 9 are a little bit different.

2667
01:35:42,765 --> 01:35:44,484
So let's see how this now works.

2668
01:35:44,685 --> 01:35:48,214
Let me go back to my terminal window and remake this cat.

2669
01:35:48,484 --> 01:35:49,004
Let me doca again.

2670
01:35:50,084 --> 01:35:52,955
Let me not cooperate and type in like -1 again

2671
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:55,055
and notice I am reprompted this time.

2672
01:35:55,064 --> 01:35:55,205
Fine,

2673
01:35:55,285 --> 01:35:55,444
fine,

2674
01:35:55,475 --> 01:35:55,645
fine.

2675
01:35:55,725 --> 01:35:56,645
Let's type in 3.

2676
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,450
And now it works,

2677
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:01,109
but you can perhaps logically see where this is going.

2678
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:02,810
Let me go ahead and run this againca,

2679
01:36:04,109 --> 01:36:05,220
type in -1,

2680
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:06,790
type in -1,

2681
01:36:07,149 --> 01:36:07,669
and huh,

2682
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,520
it didn't prompt me again,

2683
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:11,430
but that's consistent with the code.

2684
01:36:11,509 --> 01:36:13,459
If I hide my terminal window here,

2685
01:36:13,629 --> 01:36:15,040
you'll notice that I've got 1,

2686
01:36:15,189 --> 01:36:18,580
maybe 2 tries to get this question right,

2687
01:36:18,709 --> 01:36:21,020
and after that there's no more prompting of me.

2688
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:25,029
Now you can kind of imagine that this is probably not the best way to do this.

2689
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:28,720
If I were to go inside of line 9 and then move the cursor down and say,

2690
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:28,970
OK,

2691
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,629
well if N still doesn't it still is less than 0,

2692
01:36:32,959 --> 01:36:33,180
well,

2693
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,379
let's just do get into again and ask what's N question mark and heck,

2694
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:37,640
OK,

2695
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,850
if it's still less than 0,

2696
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:40,040
well,

2697
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,790
let's just keep asking the same,

2698
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:42,080
right?

2699
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,069
Why is this bad?

2700
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:46,169
I'm repeating myself.

2701
01:36:46,339 --> 01:36:48,700
I'm essentially copying and pasting even though I'm retyping.

2702
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:49,839
I mean this just never ends,

2703
01:36:49,939 --> 01:36:50,060
right?

2704
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,899
Like how many chances are you going to give the user?

2705
01:36:52,129 --> 01:36:56,970
In spirit you'd hope that they don't not cooperate this many times,

2706
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:00,569
but really to do this the right way we should probably prompt them

2707
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:03,779
potentially as many times as it takes to get the correct input.

2708
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:06,410
So this is not the right path for us to be going down.

2709
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,899
But of course we have already now this notion of like

2710
01:37:08,899 --> 01:37:11,580
a loop whereby we could just do this in a loop.

2711
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,250
Ask the question once and maybe just repeat the question again,

2712
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:15,549
again,

2713
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:17,000
but the same question.

2714
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:18,109
So how might I do this?

2715
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:18,279
Well,

2716
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:20,470
let me go ahead and delete all of this

2717
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:22,830
and let me just try to spell this out logically.

2718
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:25,859
So I want to get a variable N from the user

2719
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:29,500
and let's go ahead as follows.

2720
01:37:29,509 --> 01:37:30,120
While

2721
01:37:30,799 --> 01:37:31,160
true,

2722
01:37:31,509 --> 01:37:32,939
I know how to do infinite loops now,

2723
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:35,220
and even though that created a problem for me with the cat,

2724
01:37:35,509 --> 01:37:38,149
I bet we can sort of terminate the loop prematurely.

2725
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,009
I proposed earlier as follows.

2726
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:46,069
I could do this in N equals get in and ask the user again what's N question mark.

2727
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:47,029
And then

2728
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:48,669
I could do something like this.

2729
01:37:48,839 --> 01:37:49,330
If

2730
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,160
N

2731
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:51,629
is less than 0,

2732
01:37:51,839 --> 01:37:52,069
well then,

2733
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:52,600
you know what,

2734
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,229
go ahead and just continue on with the same loop.

2735
01:37:55,649 --> 01:37:58,229
Else if it is not the case that N is less than 0,

2736
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:58,879
what do I want to do?

2737
01:37:58,919 --> 01:38:00,319
I want to break out of this loop.

2738
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:01,549
So this is new syntax.

2739
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,839
This is something you can do and see whereby if N is.

2740
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:05,569
Less than 0,

2741
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:10,040
fine.in means go back to the start of the loop and do the same exact thing again.

2742
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:12,049
Otherwise if you instead say break,

2743
01:38:12,129 --> 01:38:15,240
it means break out of the loop and go to below

2744
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:18,729
whatever curly brace is associated with that loop.

2745
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,479
So continue essentially brings you to the top,

2746
01:38:20,649 --> 01:38:22,600
brake brings you to the bottom if you will.

2747
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:24,209
So logically I think this is right,

2748
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:24,669
but

2749
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:29,240
this code curiously isn't quite going to work and get me a value for N.

2750
01:38:29,689 --> 01:38:31,370
Let me go ahead and open my terminal window again.

2751
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,870
Let's make this cat and

2752
01:38:34,129 --> 01:38:34,779
huh

2753
01:38:35,169 --> 01:38:43,160
cat.c line 1925 is an error use of undeclared identifier N.

2754
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:43,660
Well,

2755
01:38:43,729 --> 01:38:46,129
what does that mean again cat.C line 19.

2756
01:38:46,209 --> 01:38:49,520
Let me hide my terminal window highlight line 19

2757
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,759
N is being used in line 19,

2758
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:56,540
but I created it in line 8

2759
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:58,950
and so what's the problem?

2760
01:38:59,250 --> 01:38:59,970
Why is it?

2761
01:39:00,919 --> 01:39:02,439
Not declared seemingly,

2762
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,069
yeah.

2763
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:06,129
Like and

2764
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:07,759
Yeah,

2765
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:08,839
this is a subtlety,

2766
01:39:08,879 --> 01:39:09,520
but I'm using.

2767
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,839
I'm creating N

2768
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:12,359
inside of this loop.

2769
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,950
I mean literally between the curly braces on line 7 and 17.

2770
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,629
The implication of which

2771
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:23,990
because of how C works is that that variable only exists inside of

2772
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:25,080
that 4 loop.

2773
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,390
This is a problem of what's known as scope,

2774
01:39:27,549 --> 01:39:27,890
the.

2775
01:39:28,069 --> 01:39:28,080
and

2776
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:32,310
only exists inside of the scope of

2777
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,270
the while loop in which it was declared.

2778
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:37,040
So how do I actually fix this?

2779
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:37,430
Well,

2780
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,189
I need to logically

2781
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,279
somehow declare that variable and outside of the loop so

2782
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:46,109
that it exists later on in the program as well.

2783
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,029
And there's a few different ways I can fix this,

2784
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:48,669
but the best.

2785
01:39:48,729 --> 01:39:52,720
The way is probably to move the declaration of N,

2786
01:39:52,839 --> 01:39:53,279
so to speak,

2787
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:56,250
the creation of N outside of the curly braces,

2788
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:58,919
and maybe kind of squeeze it in here below line 5,

2789
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,089
so still inside of Main,

2790
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:00,720
whatever that is,

2791
01:40:00,839 --> 01:40:01,830
more on that next week,

2792
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,109
but in the same

2793
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:05,470
curly braces as everything else.

2794
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,870
So I can in fact do this,

2795
01:40:06,879 --> 01:40:09,279
and this is where the syntax gets a little bit different.

2796
01:40:09,609 --> 01:40:12,189
I can solve this quite simply as follows.

2797
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:16,879
I can go down to a new line 6 and just say in and semicolon,

2798
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:17,589
and that's it.

2799
01:40:17,839 --> 01:40:19,979
This declares a variable called N.

2800
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,919
It creates a variable called in and initially it doesn't give it any value,

2801
01:40:22,959 --> 01:40:24,109
so who knows what's in there.

2802
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:25,359
More on that another time.

2803
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,750
But now on line 9,

2804
01:40:26,959 --> 01:40:28,390
I don't need to recreate it.

2805
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:30,609
I just need to assign it a value.

2806
01:40:30,939 --> 01:40:38,189
And because now N has been declared on line 6 and between the curly braces on line 5

2807
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:40,470
and all the way down on 24,

2808
01:40:40,759 --> 01:40:42,419
now N is in scope,

2809
01:40:42,549 --> 01:40:43,310
so to speak,

2810
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,379
for the entirety of this code that I've written.

2811
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,509
So let me reopen my terminal window and clear that old error.

2812
01:40:49,779 --> 01:40:51,279
Let me do make cat again.

2813
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,250
Now the error messages is gone.

2814
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:54,859
Let me go ahead and do slashca.

2815
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:55,540
What's in.

2816
01:40:55,819 --> 01:40:58,379
Now I'm back in business and I can do 3 for meow meow meow.

2817
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,109
But better yet,

2818
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,640
because I'm inside of a loop now,

2819
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:01,939
watch that I can do -1,

2820
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:02,450
-1,

2821
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:05,850
1123,

2822
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:07,049
50.

2823
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,649
Finally I can cooperate with something like 3,

2824
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:11,040
and because I'm in a loop

2825
01:41:11,299 --> 01:41:13,490
that by design may very well go

2826
01:41:13,779 --> 01:41:15,950
infinitely many times until

2827
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,100
the user actually cooperates and lets me break out of.

2828
01:41:19,505 --> 01:41:20,616
That exact loop.

2829
01:41:20,826 --> 01:41:22,105
Now I strictly speaking,

2830
01:41:22,116 --> 01:41:23,666
don't need both continue and break.

2831
01:41:23,706 --> 01:41:25,375
I wanted to demonstrate that both exist,

2832
01:41:25,505 --> 01:41:27,976
but this is like twice as much code than I actually need.

2833
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:31,145
If logically I just want to break out of this loop if

2834
01:41:31,145 --> 01:41:34,175
and only if n is greater than or equal to 0,

2835
01:41:34,346 --> 01:41:36,686
because I'm sort of comfortable with the idea of zero mouses,

2836
01:41:36,706 --> 01:41:38,206
but negative makes no sense,

2837
01:41:38,456 --> 01:41:39,815
well I can just flip the logic.

2838
01:41:40,025 --> 01:41:44,215
I can say if N is greater than or equal to 0,

2839
01:41:44,585 --> 01:41:46,905
then go ahead and break and I've tightened up.

2840
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:47,832
The code

2841
01:41:48,071 --> 01:41:48,702
further.

2842
01:41:48,992 --> 01:41:50,981
I could technically do something else.

2843
01:41:51,312 --> 01:41:53,722
I could say something like if N

2844
01:41:54,231 --> 01:41:56,262
is less than

2845
01:41:56,551 --> 01:41:57,142
0,

2846
01:41:57,151 --> 01:41:57,671
but wait a minute,

2847
01:41:57,711 --> 01:41:58,512
I want to negate that.

2848
01:41:58,532 --> 01:42:01,501
You can start to do tricks like this an exclamation point

2849
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:04,142
with some additional parentheses so you can invert the logic.

2850
01:42:04,191 --> 01:42:06,102
It's arguably a little hard to read

2851
01:42:06,352 --> 01:42:08,151
even though that would be logically correct.

2852
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:10,742
So I'm just going to say more explicitly as before,

2853
01:42:10,992 --> 01:42:12,602
if N is greater than or equal to 0,

2854
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,551
break out of this here loop.

2855
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:15,979
All right,

2856
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:18,310
so this is one way to use an infinite loop,

2857
01:42:18,390 --> 01:42:21,299
but it turns out there's another construct that you can do altogether

2858
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:23,660
that is in a feature of C.

2859
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:26,419
Instead of using a while loop and forcing it to be infinite

2860
01:42:26,419 --> 01:42:29,339
by using while true and then eventually manually breaking out of it,

2861
01:42:29,509 --> 01:42:31,430
there exists another type of loop altogether,

2862
01:42:31,509 --> 01:42:33,470
and that's called a do while loop,

2863
01:42:33,509 --> 01:42:35,629
and you can literally say the word do,

2864
01:42:35,709 --> 01:42:37,100
which means do the following,

2865
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:37,709
then you can do.

2866
01:42:37,855 --> 01:42:42,565
Exactly what we did before N equals get in quote unquote what's end question mark,

2867
01:42:42,775 --> 01:42:43,895
so exactly like before,

2868
01:42:43,936 --> 01:42:48,145
but then after those curly braces you use a while

2869
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:49,286
keyword,

2870
01:42:49,456 --> 01:42:51,485
so at the end of the loop instead of the beginning,

2871
01:42:51,655 --> 01:42:53,485
and that's where you put your boolean expression.

2872
01:42:53,616 --> 01:42:55,616
I want to do all of that

2873
01:42:56,016 --> 01:42:58,445
while N is less than 0,

2874
01:42:58,605 --> 01:43:00,255
so you can kind of invert the logic.

2875
01:43:00,412 --> 01:43:03,731
And now kind of tighten things up further by just telling the computer

2876
01:43:04,082 --> 01:43:04,852
do the following.

2877
01:43:04,921 --> 01:43:05,872
What's the following?

2878
01:43:05,881 --> 01:43:09,432
Everything in between those curly braces while N is less than 0,

2879
01:43:09,441 --> 01:43:12,562
and this implicitly handles all of the continuation and all

2880
01:43:12,562 --> 01:43:16,191
of the breaking by just doing what you've said do this

2881
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:17,912
while this is true,

2882
01:43:18,001 --> 01:43:22,952
but the difference between this do while loop and a normal while loop is literally

2883
01:43:23,242 --> 01:43:25,321
that the condition is checked at the bottom.

2884
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,259
Instead of the top,

2885
01:43:27,549 --> 01:43:30,020
so when you say while parentheses something,

2886
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:34,060
that question is asked first and then you proceed maybe

2887
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:38,060
this condition is only asked at the very end and why is this useful?

2888
01:43:38,189 --> 01:43:38,270
Well,

2889
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:41,470
oftentimes when writing programs where you want to do something at least once,

2890
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,220
like you obviously want to ask the user this question at least once,

2891
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:45,770
there's no point in asking a question.

2892
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:49,569
And like while true or while anything else you should just do it

2893
01:43:49,819 --> 01:43:51,529
and then you should do it again

2894
01:43:51,779 --> 01:43:52,339
if

2895
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:56,129
the expression evaluates the true and tells you to do something.

2896
01:43:56,379 --> 01:43:58,020
Now you haven't played with these loops yet

2897
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:00,410
most likely unless you have programmed before.

2898
01:44:00,589 --> 01:44:03,209
Uh there's a fun sort of meme that's apropos of this moment,

2899
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:05,990
so let's see if this maybe causes a few chuckles

2900
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:08,250
if you remember Looney Tunes here.

2901
01:44:09,959 --> 01:44:11,689
It's funny for people

2902
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:12,689
in the know.

2903
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,459
There we go,

2904
01:44:14,509 --> 01:44:15,220
thank you.

2905
01:44:15,959 --> 01:44:16,149
OK,

2906
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:17,060
this doesn't make sense.

2907
01:44:17,149 --> 01:44:18,069
It eventually will,

2908
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:19,270
and it still might not be funny,

2909
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,859
but it will at least make sense,

2910
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:22,870
and it illustrates the difference between do while loop,

2911
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:23,700
like the roadrunner,

2912
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:27,140
is stopping because he's checking the condition while not on edge,

2913
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,910
he'll run,

2914
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:28,830
but if he is on the edge,

2915
01:44:28,879 --> 01:44:30,259
he's not going to proceed further.

2916
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,740
But of course the coyote here,

2917
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:36,189
he's going to do running no matter what and then only too late does he check.

2918
01:44:36,959 --> 01:44:37,220
Ha ha,

2919
01:44:37,379 --> 01:44:38,500
he's still on the edge.

2920
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:39,089
All right,

2921
01:44:39,299 --> 01:44:39,569
so,

2922
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:40,160
ah,

2923
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:40,810
thank you.

2924
01:44:41,129 --> 01:44:41,560
All right,

2925
01:44:41,779 --> 01:44:42,439
now you're cool.

2926
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:42,899
All right,

2927
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:43,490
so

2928
01:44:43,779 --> 01:44:46,060
many more memes will now make sense as a result,

2929
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:50,129
but let's go ahead and revisit this code and maybe do something a little bit

2930
01:44:50,129 --> 01:44:53,899
different here whereby we no longer want to just futz around with some of these,

2931
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:54,450
uh,

2932
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,500
conditionals and these loops.

2933
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,859
Let's actually make the software a little better designed.

2934
01:44:57,899 --> 01:44:58,649
And to do this,

2935
01:44:58,729 --> 01:45:02,180
we'll revisit an idea that we touched on last week and he had to do with problems.

2936
01:45:02,485 --> 01:45:02,565
0,

2937
01:45:02,616 --> 01:45:04,936
which was like create your own function like C

2938
01:45:04,936 --> 01:45:06,536
does not come with everything you might want.

2939
01:45:06,706 --> 01:45:09,166
CS 50 library is not going to come with everything you might want.

2940
01:45:09,295 --> 01:45:10,045
And at the end of the day,

2941
01:45:10,096 --> 01:45:13,645
a lot of programming is about abstracting away your ideas,

2942
01:45:13,655 --> 01:45:15,286
so you solve a problem once

2943
01:45:15,496 --> 01:45:16,366
and then reuse it,

2944
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:16,775
reuse it,

2945
01:45:16,815 --> 01:45:17,326
reuse it.

2946
01:45:17,335 --> 01:45:17,616
And heck,

2947
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:19,735
you can package it up in a so-called library like

2948
01:45:19,735 --> 01:45:22,005
we have and let other people use it as well.

2949
01:45:22,255 --> 01:45:25,085
So here for instance in Scratch is how we could have

2950
01:45:25,496 --> 01:45:28,051
implemented the notion of meowing as by getting The

2951
01:45:28,051 --> 01:45:30,012
cat to play the sound meow until done.

2952
01:45:30,051 --> 01:45:33,441
We abstracted it away and then we had a magical new puzzle piece called meow.

2953
01:45:33,691 --> 01:45:34,251
In C,

2954
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:35,841
this is going to be a little weird today,

2955
01:45:35,912 --> 01:45:38,841
but next week these details will start to make more sense.

2956
01:45:39,171 --> 01:45:40,481
You would instead

2957
01:45:40,731 --> 01:45:43,162
do the following literally type void,

2958
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:44,881
the name of the function you want to create,

2959
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:46,961
and then void again in parentheses.

2960
01:45:47,131 --> 01:45:47,682
For now,

2961
01:45:47,921 --> 01:45:51,521
know that this is the return value of the function.

2962
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:53,332
So void means it returns nothing.

2963
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:56,859
This is the input to or the arguments to the function,

2964
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:58,700
void means it takes no inputs,

2965
01:45:58,759 --> 01:46:02,259
and that makes sense because literally meow doesn't return anything,

2966
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:03,700
it doesn't take anything,

2967
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:04,990
it just meows.

2968
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,549
It has a so-called side effect audibly last week.

2969
01:46:07,879 --> 01:46:09,149
So this means,

2970
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:09,569
hey,

2971
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:09,950
see,

2972
01:46:10,109 --> 01:46:12,580
invent a function called meow that takes no input,

2973
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:13,669
produces no output,

2974
01:46:13,709 --> 01:46:16,979
but does have a side effect of printing meow on the screen.

2975
01:46:17,229 --> 01:46:17,729
Meanwhile,

2976
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:22,509
if I wanted to do something like this in code last week where I meowed 3 times,

2977
01:46:22,669 --> 01:46:22,779
well,

2978
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:23,109
that's fine.

2979
01:46:23,189 --> 01:46:24,700
We have the building blocks for this,

2980
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:27,580
and here's where inventing your own functions starts to get more compelling.

2981
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:29,390
I can abstract away the notion of meow.

2982
01:46:29,525 --> 01:46:30,886
Now this doesn't come with C,

2983
01:46:30,916 --> 01:46:32,235
it doesn't come with the CS 50 library.

2984
01:46:32,246 --> 01:46:36,315
I just created in the previous code this meow function so I can

2985
01:46:36,315 --> 01:46:40,706
encode with a 4 loop and that new function meow 3 times.

2986
01:46:40,835 --> 01:46:42,195
But I can abstract this away further.

2987
01:46:42,275 --> 01:46:44,826
Recall that the refinement and scratch last time was this.

2988
01:46:45,076 --> 01:46:48,996
I could edit the new function and I can say it actually does take an input,

2989
01:46:49,116 --> 01:46:50,235
otherwise known as an argument,

2990
01:46:50,395 --> 01:46:50,886
called N.

2991
01:46:51,182 --> 01:46:54,381
And I clarified that this means to me meow some number of times and

2992
01:46:54,381 --> 01:46:59,742
then inside of those scratch blocks I repeated N times the meowing act.

2993
01:46:59,961 --> 01:47:00,041
Well,

2994
01:47:00,162 --> 01:47:02,401
in C I can achieve the exact same thing even

2995
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:03,961
though it's going to look a little more cryptic,

2996
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:04,472
but

2997
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,751
meow still returns nothing.

2998
01:47:06,841 --> 01:47:08,921
It has an audible or visual side effect,

2999
01:47:08,972 --> 01:47:10,392
but it doesn't return a value.

3000
01:47:10,602 --> 01:47:12,832
But this version does take an input,

3001
01:47:13,082 --> 01:47:14,191
and this might look a little weird,

3002
01:47:14,242 --> 01:47:15,091
but just like before,

3003
01:47:15,102 --> 01:47:16,981
when you create a variable in C,

3004
01:47:17,162 --> 01:47:18,801
you specify the type and the name.

3005
01:47:19,379 --> 01:47:21,549
When you invent your own function in C

3006
01:47:21,939 --> 01:47:24,129
and it takes one or more inputs,

3007
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,509
AKA arguments,

3008
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:27,009
you specify the type

3009
01:47:27,299 --> 01:47:29,209
and the name of those as well.

3010
01:47:29,379 --> 01:47:30,529
No semicolons up there,

3011
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,089
just inside of the parentheses,

3012
01:47:32,129 --> 01:47:34,209
and you'll get used to with practice this convention,

3013
01:47:34,339 --> 01:47:38,259
but the rest of this code is exactly the same except instead of 3.

3014
01:47:38,609 --> 01:47:40,069
I'm now using N.

3015
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:40,520
So again,

3016
01:47:40,589 --> 01:47:43,359
I'm just composing the exact same ideas as last week,

3017
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:45,419
even though it looks way more cryptic this week,

3018
01:47:45,589 --> 01:47:47,419
but it will come more and more familiar

3019
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:48,180
with

3020
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:49,859
more and more practice.

3021
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:52,379
So how can I go about implementing this

3022
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:53,620
myself?

3023
01:47:53,709 --> 01:47:53,790
Well,

3024
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:55,069
let me propose that.

3025
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,669
We do something like this.

3026
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:00,240
Let me go back to VS code here and let me go ahead and

3027
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,169
let's really delete most of the code that I've written inside of Maine

3028
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:07,350
and let me just suppose for the moment that meowing exists,

3029
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:10,959
and I'm going to go ahead and say for the first version for into I equals.

3030
01:48:11,399 --> 01:48:12,529
less than 3,

3031
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,049
so we're not going to take input yet.

3032
01:48:14,259 --> 01:48:15,049
I plus plus,

3033
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,890
and then I'm going to go ahead here and say

3034
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:19,419
meow is what I want this function to do.

3035
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:20,540
Now if I scroll back up,

3036
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:22,689
you'll see there's no definition of meow yet,

3037
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:23,410
so

3038
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:24,779
I'm going to invent that too.

3039
01:48:24,859 --> 01:48:26,729
I'm going to go up here and say void,

3040
01:48:27,299 --> 01:48:27,740
meow,

3041
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:28,569
void,

3042
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,939
and again this first version means no input,

3043
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:31,770
no output,

3044
01:48:31,979 --> 01:48:33,049
just a side effect,

3045
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:35,259
and that side effect super simply is going to be

3046
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:37,529
to say just quote unquote meow with the backslash n.

3047
01:48:38,009 --> 01:48:38,740
And now

3048
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:41,020
if I go and open my terminal window,

3049
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:42,419
clear it from before,

3050
01:48:42,669 --> 01:48:44,709
do make cat so far so good,

3051
01:48:44,919 --> 01:48:45,779
scat,

3052
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:46,830
we're back in business,

3053
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:48,700
but I've abstracted the function away.

3054
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:50,109
Now much like last week where I sort

3055
01:48:50,109 --> 01:48:53,740
of dramatically dragged the meow definition way down

3056
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:56,220
to the bottom of the screen just to make the point that you don't need to

3057
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:57,100
see it anymore,

3058
01:48:57,149 --> 01:48:57,620
out of sight,

3059
01:48:57,669 --> 01:48:58,419
out of mind,

3060
01:48:58,629 --> 01:49:00,220
let me sort of try to do the same here.

3061
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:00,740
Let me

3062
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,149
highlight and delete that.

3063
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:03,850
And like go way,

3064
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:04,069
way,

3065
01:49:04,169 --> 01:49:07,169
way down arbitrarily just to be dramatic and paste it near

3066
01:49:07,169 --> 01:49:09,200
like the 100th line of code and scroll back up.

3067
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:10,040
Now out of sight,

3068
01:49:10,089 --> 01:49:10,660
out of mind.

3069
01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:12,609
I've already implemented the idea of meowing.

3070
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:14,609
We don't need to see or talk about it again.

3071
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:17,080
But there is a caveat in C.

3072
01:49:17,410 --> 01:49:20,080
When I now clear my terminal and make this cat,

3073
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:22,049
now I've introduced a problem,

3074
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:24,089
and there's like more problems it seems than code.

3075
01:49:24,169 --> 01:49:26,240
Let me scroll back up to the first such error

3076
01:49:26,529 --> 01:49:27,520
and you'll see this

3077
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:29,410
on line 9 of cat.

3078
01:49:30,569 --> 01:49:30,890
9,

3079
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:31,680
there's an error.

3080
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:35,649
Call to undeclared function meow and then something fairly arcane.

3081
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:39,930
But that means that meow is no longer recognized as an actual function.

3082
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:42,290
I know that it doesn't come from CSST.H,

3083
01:49:42,299 --> 01:49:45,310
and I know it doesn't come from standard IO.H. It's just down there.

3084
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:48,299
But why is the compiler being kind of dumb here?

3085
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:49,459
Uh,

3086
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:49,979
yeah.

3087
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,569
defined the

3088
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:53,700
Yeah,

3089
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:56,089
because insofar as the first version worked,

3090
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,779
like logically it would seem that putting it at the bottom

3091
01:49:58,779 --> 01:50:03,250
was just a bad idea because C compilers are fairly simplistic.

3092
01:50:03,259 --> 01:50:06,540
Like they won't proactively do you the favor of like checking

3093
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,169
all the way down to the bottom of the file.

3094
01:50:08,339 --> 01:50:09,299
They're going to take you literally.

3095
01:50:09,419 --> 01:50:12,109
So if meow doesn't exist as of line 9,

3096
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:13,069
that's on you.

3097
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,330
Like that is an error.

3098
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:17,700
So I could fix this by just undoing what I did.

3099
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:19,350
Move it way back up to the top,

3100
01:50:19,479 --> 01:50:22,629
but let me argue that in general when writing C programs,

3101
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,560
the main function which I keep using and we'll talk more about next

3102
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,029
week is literally meant to be the main part of your code.

3103
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,990
And so it kind of stands to reason that it should

3104
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:31,720
be at the top because when you open the file,

3105
01:50:31,729 --> 01:50:34,279
it'd be nice to see the main program that you care about,

3106
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:35,270
the main function.

3107
01:50:35,479 --> 01:50:37,279
So there's an argument to be made that it's a little

3108
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:39,669
annoying to have to put my functions all at the top,

3109
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:42,080
which is just going to push main further and further down.

3110
01:50:42,419 --> 01:50:43,709
So there is a solution,

3111
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,479
and this is dare say the only time copying and pasting is appropriate.

3112
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,450
Let me delete most of these blank lines,

3113
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,950
which is unnecessarily

3114
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:52,069
dramatic,

3115
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:55,430
and just move it below main as over here.

3116
01:50:55,879 --> 01:51:02,509
The way I can uh the solution here though is to do this to copy the first line

3117
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,200
of the main function.

3118
01:51:04,509 --> 01:51:06,189
It's so called signature

3119
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:11,410
and then just put that one line and only that one line with a semicolon above main

3120
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,490
and this

3121
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,529
is what's known as a prototype.

3122
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:18,189
So a prototype is just a bit of a hint to the compiler,

3123
01:51:18,259 --> 01:51:19,290
a promise if you will,

3124
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:19,979
that hey,

3125
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:20,770
compiler,

3126
01:51:20,979 --> 01:51:22,470
there will exist a function called meow.

3127
01:51:22,939 --> 01:51:26,569
It takes no input and it returns no output semicolon,

3128
01:51:26,629 --> 01:51:30,229
and it's on the honor system that it will eventually exist later in the file.

3129
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:31,560
We'll talk more about this next week,

3130
01:51:31,589 --> 01:51:32,419
why that works,

3131
01:51:32,549 --> 01:51:35,540
but this is sort of a promise to the compiler that it will

3132
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:37,259
eventually be defined.

3133
01:51:37,529 --> 01:51:40,859
Now what I've done here on line 4 as an aside is what's generally known as a comment.

3134
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:44,549
I just wanted to put on the screen exactly what I was verbalizing.

3135
01:51:44,759 --> 01:51:47,680
Anything in C that starts with slash slash is a note to self,

3136
01:51:47,759 --> 01:51:49,189
like a sticky note in scratch,

3137
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,419
which is just for the human,

3138
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,270
not for the computer,

3139
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:53,799
and it's a way of reminding yourself or someone else what's

3140
01:51:53,799 --> 01:51:56,350
going on on that line or those lines of code.

3141
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,200
But I'll go ahead and delete it for now is unnecessary because

3142
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,790
now if I go back into my terminal and clear those errors,

3143
01:52:01,979 --> 01:52:03,359
make this cat again now.

3144
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,689
It does work

3145
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,600
because the

3146
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:08,750
the meow function has been defined

3147
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,750
exactly where it should be,

3148
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:13,049
and now I can make the new version of this

3149
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,549
cat even better.

3150
01:52:14,799 --> 01:52:15,549
I could

3151
01:52:15,799 --> 01:52:21,029
change the function meow to take a variable n as input for the number of times,

3152
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,160
and then in here I could do something like my 4

3153
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:29,069
loop 4 into i equals 01 less than Ni plus plus,

3154
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,000
and then in this.

3155
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:31,160
For loop,

3156
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:32,700
I can print out quote unquote meow,

3157
01:52:33,259 --> 01:52:34,129
and then

3158
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:37,729
I'm gonna have to change this too because I have to copy and repaste it if you will,

3159
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:39,089
or just manually fix that.

3160
01:52:39,339 --> 01:52:41,509
But now I can get rid of all of this

3161
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:43,180
and do meow 3,

3162
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,209
for instance,

3163
01:52:44,459 --> 01:52:48,009
and this now will be the second version of the scratch code if you will,

3164
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:51,220
makeA still gonna work exactly the same meow meow meow,

3165
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,609
but now I've implemented my own function that does take input

3166
01:52:54,939 --> 01:52:56,729
even though it doesn't happen to

3167
01:52:57,209 --> 01:52:57,850
return

3168
01:52:58,339 --> 01:52:59,330
any outputs.

3169
01:53:00,569 --> 01:53:00,859
All right,

3170
01:53:00,979 --> 01:53:01,839
questions.

3171
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:03,850
On any of these

3172
01:53:04,299 --> 01:53:05,529
examples just yet.

3173
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:07,180
Confusion

3174
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:09,580
All right,

3175
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:12,500
let me add one other feature to this to demonstrate that we

3176
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,850
can take not only input but actually produce output if we want.

3177
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,930
If I go back into

3178
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:20,410
this code here,

3179
01:53:20,819 --> 01:53:25,129
let me propose that it's a little silly to be hard coding that is fixating 3.

3180
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:27,290
It'd be nice to get input from the user,

3181
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,580
so I could do this.

3182
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:32,979
I could use in N equals get in and say something like.

3183
01:53:33,075 --> 01:53:35,935
Like what's question mark

3184
01:53:36,104 --> 01:53:40,134
and then I could pass N in if only to demonstrate a couple of things.

3185
01:53:40,265 --> 01:53:40,975
So one,

3186
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:42,185
now the program's dynamic,

3187
01:53:42,225 --> 01:53:44,075
I'm going to ask the user how many times to meow

3188
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:46,745
and I'm going to pass in that value n.

3189
01:53:46,944 --> 01:53:50,575
Now this deliberately is confusing at the moment because wait a minute,

3190
01:53:50,705 --> 01:53:52,975
I got N defined here,

3191
01:53:53,185 --> 01:53:53,825
used here,

3192
01:53:53,904 --> 01:53:55,455
but then redefined here

3193
01:53:55,745 --> 01:53:57,145
and then reused here.

3194
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:02,700
So it turns out that even if you create n up here and use the name N,

3195
01:54:03,089 --> 01:54:06,890
no other functions can see it for that same issue of scope.

3196
01:54:06,919 --> 01:54:07,609
So for instance,

3197
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:09,799
suppose I didn't quite remember this,

3198
01:54:10,129 --> 01:54:12,129
and I sort of naively just said void,

3199
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,479
meow doesn't need to take any inputs because heck,

3200
01:54:15,649 --> 01:54:17,279
N is already defined in Maine.

3201
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:20,240
Let me go ahead and open my terminal and clear it,

3202
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,879
make CA and see what error comes out here.

3203
01:54:24,370 --> 01:54:24,729
Well,

3204
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,770
error oh sorry.

3205
01:54:27,149 --> 01:54:28,299
I made two mistakes here.

3206
01:54:28,569 --> 01:54:28,620
Let me,

3207
01:54:28,649 --> 01:54:31,580
I also have to change the prototype up here to say void,

3208
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:34,390
which means again meow takes no inputs.

3209
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:36,359
Let me go ahead now and rerun

3210
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:37,430
make CAT,

3211
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:41,169
and there we have an undeclared identifier again N.

3212
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,020
So in cat.

3213
01:54:42,299 --> 01:54:43,100
C line 14,

3214
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:43,970
which is here,

3215
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,089
it doesn't like that I'm using N.

3216
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:46,779
But wait a minute,

3217
01:54:46,839 --> 01:54:48,089
I created N here,

3218
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:49,810
but for the same logic as earlier,

3219
01:54:49,859 --> 01:54:50,229
that's fine.

3220
01:54:50,299 --> 01:54:51,779
You create an N on line A,

3221
01:54:51,859 --> 01:54:53,529
but where does N exist?

3222
01:54:53,819 --> 01:54:54,750
In what scope?

3223
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:57,759
Yeah,

3224
01:54:58,020 --> 01:54:59,459
only between the curly braces,

3225
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,899
which is lines 7 and 10.

3226
01:55:00,979 --> 01:55:02,520
So by the time you get down to 14,

3227
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:03,850
it's out of scope,

3228
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:04,609
so to speak,

3229
01:55:04,819 --> 01:55:05,850
so it just doesn't work.

3230
01:55:05,979 --> 01:55:08,370
So the solution is exactly what I did the first time.

3231
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:11,370
I can pass it into meow as input,

3232
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:13,850
and I have to tell C to expect that input,

3233
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:15,770
and I can use the same name,

3234
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:18,220
but arguably that's going to get confusing sometimes.

3235
01:55:18,339 --> 01:55:19,290
But let me do this.

3236
01:55:19,419 --> 01:55:20,779
Let me go back into my code.

3237
01:55:21,149 --> 01:55:24,589
Let me undo this change such that now meow does take an input,

3238
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,479
but instead of just calling it N and using N everywhere for number,

3239
01:55:27,509 --> 01:55:28,259
this is crazy,

3240
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:30,419
let's just call this like times.

3241
01:55:30,709 --> 01:55:33,220
So meow takes some number of times

3242
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:35,100
and then it uses that value,

3243
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:38,350
and now I'm passing in on line 9 N,

3244
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:43,540
but in the context of the meow function on lines 12 onward,

3245
01:55:43,759 --> 01:55:45,220
that same variable n.

3246
01:55:45,609 --> 01:55:48,589
Is now referred to as times because you're passing it in as

3247
01:55:48,589 --> 01:55:52,549
input and giving it its own name and that's totally your prerogative.

3248
01:55:52,759 --> 01:55:55,069
It's just a matter of scope.

3249
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,810
I mean I could have called it M or some other letter of the alphabet,

3250
01:55:57,919 --> 01:56:01,750
but times is even more clear because that's the number of times I want the cat

3251
01:56:02,209 --> 01:56:02,859
to meow.

3252
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:03,549
But again,

3253
01:56:03,649 --> 01:56:07,069
the whole point here is just this matter of scope.

3254
01:56:08,169 --> 01:56:08,189
All right,

3255
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:12,310
so let's take a higher level look now at some of the things we've been thinking about,

3256
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:15,000
and then we'll do a final deep diver too on

3257
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,109
some of the corner some of the problems that we

3258
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:18,799
can solve with all of these building blocks and some

3259
01:56:18,799 --> 01:56:21,350
of the problems that we're sort of ignoring for now.

3260
01:56:21,479 --> 01:56:22,839
So when it comes to writing good code,

3261
01:56:22,930 --> 01:56:25,000
CS 50 and really the world in general tends

3262
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,350
to focus on these kinds of axes correctness,

3263
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:27,919
design,

3264
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:28,359
and style.

3265
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:29,169
What does this mean?

3266
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:31,479
Correctness just means does the code work the way

3267
01:56:31,479 --> 01:56:33,229
it's supposed to in the context of a class,

3268
01:56:33,259 --> 01:56:35,080
it should do exactly what the homework assignment,

3269
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,080
AKA problem set,

3270
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:36,399
tells you.

3271
01:56:36,476 --> 01:56:37,576
To do in the real world,

3272
01:56:37,706 --> 01:56:39,905
it should do exactly what someone decided

3273
01:56:39,905 --> 01:56:41,585
the software should do the product manager,

3274
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:42,226
the CEO,

3275
01:56:42,266 --> 01:56:42,855
or the like.

3276
01:56:43,045 --> 01:56:45,186
Correctness just means it behaves as it should.

3277
01:56:45,425 --> 01:56:48,826
That's different though from how well designed the code might be,

3278
01:56:48,855 --> 01:56:49,895
and we've seen that a few times.

3279
01:56:50,025 --> 01:56:53,616
I've had some simplistic examples in Scratch and C that were 100% correct,

3280
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:55,175
like it did the right thing logically,

3281
01:56:55,525 --> 01:56:57,096
but I was wasting the computer's time.

3282
01:56:57,105 --> 01:56:59,016
I was wasting the human's time by asking more

3283
01:56:59,016 --> 01:57:01,866
boolean expressions than I needed to and so forth.

3284
01:57:01,916 --> 01:57:04,666
So design is more about like in the in the world.

3285
01:57:04,932 --> 01:57:08,622
English like not only saying things that are correct but doing it well,

3286
01:57:08,671 --> 01:57:10,841
like and making a good cogent argument,

3287
01:57:10,901 --> 01:57:12,921
not just one that happens to be correct.

3288
01:57:13,291 --> 01:57:15,651
Style meanwhile is the third axis on which

3289
01:57:15,651 --> 01:57:18,082
we might evaluate the quality of someone's code,

3290
01:57:18,171 --> 01:57:21,091
and that's more of the aesthetics like is everything pretty printed,

3291
01:57:21,171 --> 01:57:22,682
that is nicely indented,

3292
01:57:22,852 --> 01:57:24,852
are variables well named and not just called

3293
01:57:24,852 --> 01:57:27,202
X Y Z arbitrarily or something like that.

3294
01:57:27,412 --> 01:57:29,452
So style matters really to other humans,

3295
01:57:29,571 --> 01:57:30,481
not to the computer,

3296
01:57:30,611 --> 01:57:31,731
but to other humans.

3297
01:57:31,771 --> 01:57:32,932
And to illustrate these.

3298
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:35,950
And you'll see that in problem set one onward you'll

3299
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:37,700
be given a number of tools that you can use.

3300
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:39,629
So one of those tools is called Check 50,

3301
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,859
and in each problem set,

3302
01:57:41,069 --> 01:57:43,140
problem in C and Python and other languages,

3303
01:57:43,149 --> 01:57:45,990
you'll be showed how you can test your own code and you

3304
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:49,220
can literally run a command that CS50 created called Check 50.

3305
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:51,109
You'll then specify what's called a slug,

3306
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,660
which just means a unique identifier for that homework problem,

3307
01:57:53,770 --> 01:57:55,779
and you'll get quick feedback

3308
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:57,660
on whether or not your code is correct.

3309
01:57:57,709 --> 01:58:00,740
It doesn't mean it's well implemented or well designed or.

3310
01:58:01,071 --> 01:58:02,262
that is well stylized,

3311
01:58:02,472 --> 01:58:05,682
but at least that's the first gauntlet in getting good code submitted.

3312
01:58:05,952 --> 01:58:07,432
Design though is much more subjective.

3313
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:09,872
Design is something you get feedback on from a human,

3314
01:58:09,952 --> 01:58:10,332
for instance,

3315
01:58:10,392 --> 01:58:13,082
in section or a teaching assistant or in software.

3316
01:58:13,151 --> 01:58:15,432
You can actually see at top VS code there's a

3317
01:58:15,432 --> 01:58:17,821
couple of buttons that I haven't yet used but could.

3318
01:58:18,032 --> 01:58:20,651
Design 50 is built on top of the CS50 duck,

3319
01:58:20,751 --> 01:58:23,051
whereby if you have a program open in a tab,

3320
01:58:23,231 --> 01:58:24,412
you click Design 50,

3321
01:58:24,492 --> 01:58:27,001
you will get chat GPT like

3322
01:58:27,432 --> 01:58:28,392
advice on how you can.

3323
01:58:28,483 --> 01:58:30,224
Prove not the correctness of that code,

3324
01:58:30,233 --> 01:58:31,874
but the design of that code,

3325
01:58:31,954 --> 01:58:33,034
the quality thereof,

3326
01:58:33,074 --> 01:58:34,954
which is a bit more subjective and modeled

3327
01:58:34,954 --> 01:58:37,383
after what a good teaching assistant might say.

3328
01:58:37,713 --> 01:58:40,704
Style 50 meanwhile is a third tool that will provide

3329
01:58:40,704 --> 01:58:42,594
you with feedback on the style of your code.

3330
01:58:42,613 --> 01:58:44,354
It will show you on the left what your code looks

3331
01:58:44,354 --> 01:58:47,344
like and on the right what your code really should look like

3332
01:58:47,594 --> 01:58:49,594
insofar as it should be consistent with what we've taught

3333
01:58:49,594 --> 01:58:52,713
in class and consistent with CS 50's so-called style guide.

3334
01:58:52,874 --> 01:58:55,994
And those of you who have some prior programming experience undoubtedly won't.

3335
01:58:56,085 --> 01:58:58,105
Like some of CS 50's stylistic choices,

3336
01:58:58,155 --> 01:59:00,445
and that's going to be the case in the real world too,

3337
01:59:00,715 --> 01:59:01,866
but as I alluded to earlier,

3338
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:05,315
in typical companies you would have an official style guide or tool to which

3339
01:59:05,315 --> 01:59:07,956
everyone adheres so that everyone's code actually

3340
01:59:07,956 --> 01:59:09,436
looks the same as everyone else's,

3341
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:10,875
even though people have contributed

3342
01:59:11,155 --> 01:59:13,355
different solutions to problems.

3343
01:59:13,436 --> 01:59:14,186
So correctness,

3344
01:59:14,436 --> 01:59:14,826
design,

3345
01:59:14,835 --> 01:59:16,166
style is not only how we,

3346
01:59:16,335 --> 01:59:19,866
but really the world writ large tends to evaluate the quality of code,

3347
01:59:20,036 --> 01:59:23,545
and we do it by way of the CS 50 specific tools here.

3348
01:59:24,089 --> 01:59:24,109
All right,

3349
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,100
how about

3350
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:30,990
one final flourish then to this here program back in VS code,

3351
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,580
I've got a correct solution right now.

3352
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:33,919
Um,

3353
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:34,879
it's well styled.

3354
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:37,680
I'll stipulate even though it could stand to have some more comments.

3355
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:38,640
So for instance,

3356
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:40,229
I could do something like this,

3357
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,370
like meow

3358
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,950
uh some number of times,

3359
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:47,140
a comment to myself or up here I could say something like,

3360
01:59:47,479 --> 01:59:48,029
uh,

3361
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:48,520
get.

3362
01:59:49,049 --> 01:59:53,549
A number from user just to remind myself and my TA

3363
01:59:53,549 --> 01:59:56,029
or my colleague what it is this code is doing,

3364
01:59:56,319 --> 01:59:58,720
but what more could I do in the way of design?

3365
01:59:58,799 --> 01:59:58,919
Well,

3366
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,720
this function here get in will indeed get me an integer,

3367
02:00:01,839 --> 02:00:03,310
but not just positive or zero,

3368
02:00:03,729 --> 02:00:04,589
but negative,

3369
02:00:04,629 --> 02:00:07,399
and I could go in and add a bunch of code like before,

3370
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:09,870
like I could actually do instead of this line,

3371
02:00:09,879 --> 02:00:11,649
I could do something like in and.

3372
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:17,700
Semicolon do the following N equals get in and then I can say what's

3373
02:00:18,069 --> 02:00:21,729
N question mark and then after that I can do something like while

3374
02:00:22,189 --> 02:00:23,259
N is less than

3375
02:00:23,509 --> 02:00:24,040
0,

3376
02:00:24,149 --> 02:00:28,660
keep doing that so I can have a pretty verbose implementation of getting user input

3377
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:30,740
or I can implement

3378
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:34,049
another function of my own that only gets a

3379
02:00:34,049 --> 02:00:37,419
positive integer or non-negative integer from the user.

3380
02:00:37,669 --> 02:00:38,350
For instance,

3381
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:40,109
I might do something like this.

3382
02:00:40,629 --> 02:00:40,910
Uh,

3383
02:00:40,919 --> 02:00:41,589
I could,

3384
02:00:41,870 --> 02:00:42,029
uh,

3385
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:43,209
declare at the,

3386
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:43,509
uh,

3387
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,709
maybe below my main function a function like this,

3388
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:47,189
uh,

3389
02:00:47,319 --> 02:00:47,569
in,

3390
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:48,529
uh,

3391
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:49,229
how about

3392
02:00:49,549 --> 02:00:50,049
get

3393
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:50,620
N

3394
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:55,750
and then inside of this I might say void because I'm not going to pass in any input.

3395
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:59,970
Then inside of this function is where I'm going to do into and do Y.

3396
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:05,875
N equals get quote unquote what's n question mark and then down

3397
02:01:05,875 --> 02:01:08,424
here I'm going to do while N is less than 0,

3398
02:01:08,794 --> 02:01:09,464
but

3399
02:01:10,154 --> 02:01:11,464
rather than

3400
02:01:11,714 --> 02:01:14,354
do something immediately with N because I'm no

3401
02:01:14,354 --> 02:01:16,424
longer inside of my so-called main function,

3402
02:01:16,464 --> 02:01:17,125
what I'm going to do,

3403
02:01:17,154 --> 02:01:17,904
which is new,

3404
02:01:18,024 --> 02:01:20,194
is return this value n.

3405
02:01:20,529 --> 02:01:23,470
And notice that this notion of returning a value,

3406
02:01:23,549 --> 02:01:25,459
which is the first time I've done this explicitly,

3407
02:01:25,669 --> 02:01:28,620
is consistent with this little hint here on my 19,

3408
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:32,910
which implies that this get end function which I'm inventing is going to return,

3409
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:33,549
not void,

3410
02:01:33,629 --> 02:01:34,500
which means nothing

3411
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:35,600
but an integer,

3412
02:01:35,629 --> 02:01:38,259
and that's the whole purpose of this function in life now.

3413
02:01:38,509 --> 02:01:39,950
If I scroll back down here,

3414
02:01:40,029 --> 02:01:42,759
I can get rid of this whole block

3415
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:43,870
of code.

3416
02:01:44,279 --> 02:01:51,410
And just say get in from the user and then I can immediately call meow with that value.

3417
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:52,620
I need to do one other thing.

3418
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:54,689
I need to highlight this line of code here,

3419
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:57,770
and I'm going to go ahead and add another prototype up top,

3420
02:01:57,819 --> 02:02:00,950
which is the only time again for now that copy paste is encouraged

3421
02:02:01,339 --> 02:02:01,770
and

3422
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,370
best to do.

3423
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,029
So I've invented my own function,

3424
02:02:05,149 --> 02:02:05,589
get in,

3425
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:09,109
the whole point being now I have this sort of abstraction here of a function

3426
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:12,620
whose whole sole purpose in life is to get me not just an integer,

3427
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:17,520
but one that is zero or positive and not negative.

3428
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:19,339
If I open my terminal window,

3429
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:20,899
clear the mess from before,

3430
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:24,779
make this catca what's N3,

3431
02:02:25,029 --> 02:02:26,339
I'm now back in business,

3432
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:29,819
and again we've essentially translated from scratch last time

3433
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:31,109
into C this time.

3434
02:02:31,870 --> 02:02:34,399
Exactly how we might modularize now the code,

3435
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,439
abstract away these lower level details,

3436
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:40,089
and ultimately create my own function that as before takes not

3437
02:02:40,089 --> 02:02:43,009
only arguments but in this case has not only side effects,

3438
02:02:43,169 --> 02:02:47,290
it doesn't have side effects but rather a return value this time.

3439
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:48,919
All right,

3440
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:49,990
so as you walked in,

3441
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:53,640
we had a little walkthrough of Super Mario Brothers playing from yesteryear,

3442
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:56,560
which was a side scrolling game in which Mario would jump down and go up,

3443
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:56,759
down,

3444
02:02:56,799 --> 02:02:57,000
left,

3445
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,529
right and try to collect coins and make it to the end of the level.

3446
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:02,720
There's a lot of obstacles throughout this kind of game

3447
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:04,669
whereby the world might look a little something like this,

3448
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:06,509
like there's a pit that Mario's got to jump over,

3449
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:09,720
and then there's these coins hidden typically behind these question marks that he

3450
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:12,189
can jump up and hit his head with and actually accrue points.

3451
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:14,160
Now we're not going to do anything graphical just yet.

3452
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,569
We're leaving.

3453
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:17,009
Graphics behind for now in the form of scratch,

3454
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:19,459
but with C we can implement some of these ideas.

3455
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:20,089
For instance,

3456
02:03:20,259 --> 02:03:25,290
if I were to write code to generate just this row of 4 question marks,

3457
02:03:25,299 --> 02:03:27,370
I dare say there's a bunch of ways we can do this.

3458
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:27,939
In other words,

3459
02:03:27,979 --> 02:03:30,970
let's see if we can't use all of today's building blocks to start

3460
02:03:30,970 --> 02:03:34,979
implementing our own tiny version of Super Mario Brothers in a file,

3461
02:03:35,029 --> 02:03:35,200
say,

3462
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:36,240
called Mario.c.

3463
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:38,529
So let me open and clear my terminal window.

3464
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:40,580
Let me run codemario.c.

3465
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:45,439
And let's just try to do something super simple like print 4 question marks in a row.

3466
02:03:45,609 --> 02:03:45,689
Well,

3467
02:03:45,729 --> 02:03:46,089
to do this,

3468
02:03:46,129 --> 02:03:46,810
I need printF,

3469
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:50,879
so I'm going to include standard IO.H. I'm then going to do in Main void.

3470
02:03:51,169 --> 02:03:52,720
More on that next time.

3471
02:03:52,890 --> 02:03:53,970
And inside of Main,

3472
02:03:54,169 --> 02:03:57,720
my default function that just automatically as before gets called for me,

3473
02:03:57,930 --> 02:04:00,450
I'm going to print out the simplest possible implementation,

3474
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,330
just print out for.

3475
02:04:01,459 --> 02:04:03,000
Or question marks like that.

3476
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:05,759
So no need per se for a loop just yet,

3477
02:04:05,850 --> 02:04:06,279
but

3478
02:04:06,529 --> 02:04:08,720
I think we can go down that rabbit hole too.

3479
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:10,520
Let me go down into my terminal window,

3480
02:04:10,689 --> 02:04:13,720
make this version of Mario Mario enter,

3481
02:04:14,049 --> 02:04:14,770
and voila.

3482
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:17,009
We have a very black and white version,

3483
02:04:17,129 --> 02:04:20,399
textual version of 4 question marks in the sky.

3484
02:04:20,759 --> 02:04:21,609
Now I'm kind of cheating.

3485
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,529
Here by just hard coding 4 question marks,

3486
02:04:23,609 --> 02:04:27,200
what if I wanted not 4 but 3 or 5 or some other number?

3487
02:04:27,410 --> 02:04:27,450
Well,

3488
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,810
we could do that with a loop too.

3489
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:30,560
So let me change this code here

3490
02:04:30,810 --> 02:04:36,520
and do something like this 4 I equals say 0 I less than say 4 for now,

3491
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:37,540
I plus plus.

3492
02:04:37,609 --> 02:04:39,720
Then inside of this loop I can print out

3493
02:04:40,049 --> 02:04:42,040
one question mark at a time,

3494
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:43,279
semicolon.

3495
02:04:43,490 --> 02:04:44,799
Now let me go back to the bottom,

3496
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:49,209
make this version of Mario Mario enter and hmm.

3497
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:51,500
It's not actually correct

3498
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:52,540
this time.

3499
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:56,910
So why am I getting a column instead of a row with this here change?

3500
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:57,229
Yeah.

3501
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:01,250
Yeah,

3502
02:05:01,450 --> 02:05:01,850
so I've got,

3503
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:05,089
I foolishly included the backslash N after each question mark.

3504
02:05:05,209 --> 02:05:05,370
OK,

3505
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:06,490
so that seems like an easy fix.

3506
02:05:06,569 --> 02:05:07,640
Let me get rid of that.

3507
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:10,319
Let me now recompile Mario,

3508
02:05:10,529 --> 02:05:11,740
rerun Mario,

3509
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:12,439
and now

3510
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:13,600
so close.

3511
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:15,450
Now I've just done something stupid.

3512
02:05:15,509 --> 02:05:15,609
All right,

3513
02:05:15,689 --> 02:05:16,810
I need the backslash N,

3514
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:18,919
so I think I do want this here,

3515
02:05:19,129 --> 02:05:19,930
or

3516
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:21,899
What do you

3517
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:22,990
propose instead?

3518
02:05:26,729 --> 02:05:26,959
Yeah,

3519
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,129
I should really put the backslash in outside of the loop

3520
02:05:29,129 --> 02:05:31,759
so once I'm done printing all of the question marks,

3521
02:05:31,919 --> 02:05:33,910
then I get the backslash in and that's fine,

3522
02:05:33,959 --> 02:05:35,350
even though we haven't seen this before.

3523
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:39,069
Backslash N is an escape sequence that you can certainly print by itself,

3524
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:43,919
so I do quote unquote backslash N outside of the loop below those curly braces.

3525
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,330
Now if I do make Mario Mario,

3526
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,549
now I get the 4

3527
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,140
question marks in a row.

3528
02:05:49,315 --> 02:05:52,025
As well as the new line at the very end.

3529
02:05:52,145 --> 02:05:52,425
So again,

3530
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:53,866
kind of a little baby exercise,

3531
02:05:53,905 --> 02:05:56,616
but demonstrative of how you can just take a few different

3532
02:05:56,826 --> 02:05:57,266
techniques,

3533
02:05:57,306 --> 02:06:00,226
a few different building blocks we've used to compose a correct

3534
02:06:00,226 --> 02:06:03,456
solution to what a moment ago was a brand new problem.

3535
02:06:03,585 --> 02:06:03,636
Well,

3536
02:06:03,666 --> 02:06:04,366
let's try another.

3537
02:06:04,465 --> 02:06:05,996
So later on in Super Mario Brothers,

3538
02:06:06,025 --> 02:06:07,695
when you go into sort of the underground world,

3539
02:06:07,826 --> 02:06:08,145
you see,

3540
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:09,386
or rather it's still above ground,

3541
02:06:09,436 --> 02:06:11,826
you see a column of bricks.

3542
02:06:11,901 --> 02:06:13,562
Like this that he has to jump over.

3543
02:06:13,651 --> 02:06:14,521
So those here,

3544
02:06:14,691 --> 02:06:15,852
how might we make a column?

3545
02:06:15,892 --> 02:06:15,932
Well,

3546
02:06:16,012 --> 02:06:17,682
we kind of had that solution already.

3547
02:06:17,852 --> 02:06:18,211
And in fact,

3548
02:06:18,251 --> 02:06:22,082
if I go back to VS code here and just change this version of Mario,

3549
02:06:22,091 --> 02:06:25,361
I think we can design this thing to be pretty simply the same.

3550
02:06:25,602 --> 02:06:26,921
I is less than 3 though,

3551
02:06:27,131 --> 02:06:29,921
and I do want to put the backslash N at the end there,

3552
02:06:30,211 --> 02:06:33,102
make Mario Mario and albeit textual.

3553
02:06:33,251 --> 02:06:34,372
I've got my column.

3554
02:06:34,979 --> 02:06:35,770
Of 3,

3555
02:06:37,459 --> 02:06:38,270
of let's see,

3556
02:06:38,339 --> 02:06:39,220
I don't want question marks.

3557
02:06:39,299 --> 02:06:40,189
Let's make this a little better.

3558
02:06:40,379 --> 02:06:43,209
Maybe we'll use the hash symbol because that kind of sort of looks like a square.

3559
02:06:43,459 --> 02:06:44,319
So make Mario Mario.

3560
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:45,930
OK,

3561
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,450
now we're back in business.

3562
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:49,580
But let's make it more interesting by going into Mario's

3563
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:52,279
underground now and here's the third and final Mario problem

3564
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:57,500
whereby we want to implement like this 3 by 3 grid of bricks circled here.

3565
02:06:57,770 --> 02:07:01,279
So this one's interesting because we've never done something in two dimensions.

3566
02:07:01,339 --> 02:07:02,390
I did horizontal,

3567
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:03,629
I did vertical,

3568
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:06,910
but we haven't really composed those ideas into the same.

3569
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:12,270
So let me now think a little harder this time about how I can print out row,

3570
02:07:12,439 --> 02:07:13,209
row,

3571
02:07:13,439 --> 02:07:13,970
row,

3572
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,799
and this is where if you have in your mind's eye any familiarity with.

3573
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:17,859
Old school typewriters,

3574
02:07:17,899 --> 02:07:20,689
it's kind of the same idea where you want to print a row of bricks,

3575
02:07:20,859 --> 02:07:21,930
then go back to the beginning,

3576
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:22,939
a row of bricks,

3577
02:07:22,979 --> 02:07:24,859
then go back to the beginning and a row of bricks,

3578
02:07:24,979 --> 02:07:26,959
and that's kind of what printF has always been doing for us.

3579
02:07:26,979 --> 02:07:29,459
It's printing line by line by line of text.

3580
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:30,689
It's not jumping around,

3581
02:07:30,979 --> 02:07:32,290
so we can leverage that

3582
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,770
perhaps as follows.

3583
02:07:33,779 --> 02:07:35,899
Let me go into my main function here.

3584
02:07:36,339 --> 02:07:38,500
And if I want to print out something 2 dimensional,

3585
02:07:38,689 --> 02:07:41,209
let me kind of think about it as rows and columns.

3586
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:42,839
So maybe I could do this for

3587
02:07:43,169 --> 02:07:45,540
in I equals 01 less than 3,

3588
02:07:45,649 --> 02:07:46,430
I + plus.

3589
02:07:46,529 --> 02:07:46,959
Why?

3590
02:07:47,169 --> 02:07:47,209
Well,

3591
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:48,770
I want to do something 3 times,

3592
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:51,359
even if I have no idea where I'm going with this solution.

3593
02:07:51,479 --> 02:07:54,870
I at least want to do something 3 times like 3 rows of text.

3594
02:07:55,129 --> 02:07:56,919
But how about this on each row,

3595
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:57,930
what do I want to do?

3596
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:59,899
I want to print out 3 things.

3597
02:08:00,529 --> 02:08:02,000
So I could

3598
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:06,310
steal this idea like I equals 01 less than 3,

3599
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:07,419
I plus plus,

3600
02:08:07,649 --> 02:08:09,279
and then inside of this loop,

3601
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:11,799
let me just print out one brick at a time,

3602
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:12,740
no new lines yet,

3603
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:14,080
one brick at a time,

3604
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:16,520
but there is a bit of a problem here.

3605
02:08:16,890 --> 02:08:20,160
This is correct to nest loops in this way.

3606
02:08:20,370 --> 02:08:21,729
Totally fine to have an outer loop,

3607
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:23,279
totally fine to have an inner loop,

3608
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:26,810
but I probably don't want the inner loops variable competing with

3609
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:30,169
the outer loops variable by giving them the same name.

3610
02:08:30,459 --> 02:08:31,220
And that's fine.

3611
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:34,660
It is pretty conventional in code when you want another integer,

3612
02:08:34,770 --> 02:08:36,560
and it's not I because you've used it already,

3613
02:08:36,669 --> 02:08:37,000
fine.

3614
02:08:37,089 --> 02:08:38,080
You can use J.

3615
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:41,479
So using I and J and K is generally fine.

3616
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:42,439
If you're using L,

3617
02:08:42,569 --> 02:08:42,899
M,

3618
02:08:42,930 --> 02:08:43,450
and O,

3619
02:08:43,569 --> 02:08:45,200
like at that point you're probably doing something wrong.

3620
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:46,240
There's no hard line,

3621
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:47,850
but at some point it gets ridiculous and you

3622
02:08:47,850 --> 02:08:49,649
should be coming up with better variable names.

3623
02:08:49,729 --> 02:08:50,779
But I and J,

3624
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:52,240
maybe K is fine.

3625
02:08:52,649 --> 02:08:54,290
So now what's really happening?

3626
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:56,500
Let me propose that this is my

3627
02:08:57,029 --> 02:08:57,419
Uh,

3628
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:58,759
for each row,

3629
02:08:59,069 --> 02:09:01,569
this is my for each column.

3630
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:04,779
I want to print one brick.

3631
02:09:05,069 --> 02:09:06,500
Now this isn't quite correct,

3632
02:09:06,709 --> 02:09:10,779
but let me go ahead and make this version of Mario Mario,

3633
02:09:11,029 --> 02:09:12,500
and now there's what,

3634
02:09:12,509 --> 02:09:13,270
123,

3635
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:14,700
there's 9 bricks there.

3636
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:15,669
So I'm close,

3637
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:15,910
right?

3638
02:09:15,939 --> 02:09:18,020
It's supposed to be 3 by 39 total.

3639
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:19,149
What

3640
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:23,310
do I want to do though to get this just right?

3641
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:24,450
Yeah,

3642
02:09:24,609 --> 02:09:25,410
up on the left

3643
02:09:26,379 --> 02:09:26,560
Yeah,

3644
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:26,879
what,

3645
02:09:26,919 --> 02:09:29,310
on what line number would you or after,

3646
02:09:29,689 --> 02:09:30,029
uh,

3647
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,200
where would I put the new line?

3648
02:09:33,799 --> 02:09:35,799
Cause I think I don't wanna put it here

3649
02:09:35,799 --> 02:09:37,709
because I'm gonna get myself into trouble as before,

3650
02:09:37,819 --> 02:09:38,600
how about in back?

3651
02:09:40,669 --> 02:09:41,339
After the what?

3652
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:44,770
After 13,

3653
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:45,049
yeah,

3654
02:09:45,169 --> 02:09:48,879
so after I finished printing each brick in the column

3655
02:09:49,169 --> 02:09:50,279
from left to right,

3656
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:51,649
I'm gonna go ahead and print out,

3657
02:09:51,689 --> 02:09:52,279
I think,

3658
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:53,819
a single new line here,

3659
02:09:53,970 --> 02:09:54,520
nothing else,

3660
02:09:54,649 --> 02:09:56,120
and now if I open my terminal,

3661
02:09:56,410 --> 02:09:58,540
run Mike Mario again.lamario,

3662
02:09:58,649 --> 02:09:59,720
now we've got it,

3663
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,810
and it's not a perfect square because like this.

3664
02:10:01,955 --> 02:10:05,495
One is because like the hashtags are kind of more vertical than they are horizontal,

3665
02:10:05,665 --> 02:10:07,654
but it's pretty darn close.

3666
02:10:07,754 --> 02:10:09,705
The the takeaway here being you can certainly

3667
02:10:09,705 --> 02:10:11,935
nest these kinds of ideas and compose them,

3668
02:10:12,055 --> 02:10:16,305
and honestly I and J is maybe making this more confusing than necessary.

3669
02:10:16,424 --> 02:10:19,944
I could just give these better names like row row.

3670
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:20,370
Row

3671
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:25,419
and then maybe call for column or column I can spell it out if

3672
02:10:25,419 --> 02:10:30,939
that's clear column column just to make clearer to myself to my TA,

3673
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,330
to my colleagues

3674
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:35,970
what exactly these variables represent and indeed like an old school typewriter,

3675
02:10:35,979 --> 02:10:36,700
the outer loop is.

3676
02:10:36,834 --> 02:10:39,134
Handling row by row by row,

3677
02:10:39,424 --> 02:10:42,134
but each time you're on a row you first want to do column,

3678
02:10:42,145 --> 02:10:42,435
column,

3679
02:10:42,464 --> 02:10:42,845
column,

3680
02:10:43,064 --> 02:10:43,375
column,

3681
02:10:43,384 --> 02:10:43,725
column,

3682
02:10:43,745 --> 02:10:44,185
column,

3683
02:10:44,265 --> 02:10:46,814
and that's what logically the nesting is achieving.

3684
02:10:47,015 --> 02:10:47,265
And again,

3685
02:10:47,305 --> 02:10:48,334
if I do make Mario Mario,

3686
02:10:49,154 --> 02:10:50,895
all I've done is change variable names,

3687
02:10:50,904 --> 02:10:53,214
it has no functional effect beyond that.

3688
02:10:54,069 --> 02:10:55,339
Now this is a little more subtle,

3689
02:10:55,589 --> 02:10:57,029
but there is a bit of

3690
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:59,259
duplication in this program.

3691
02:10:59,430 --> 02:11:00,859
There's a bit of magic,

3692
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,950
and this is subtle,

3693
02:11:01,990 --> 02:11:03,509
but does anyone want to conjecture

3694
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:05,819
what still could be improved here?

3695
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:10,180
What is

3696
02:11:10,609 --> 02:11:12,120
maybe rubbing you the wrong way?

3697
02:11:13,919 --> 02:11:14,149
Yeah,

3698
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:16,540
I've hard coded the 3 here and here.

3699
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:17,430
It's not a big deal.

3700
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:18,509
It's like an in-class exercise.

3701
02:11:18,589 --> 02:11:20,899
Like who really cares if I'm just manually typing 3?

3702
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:25,100
But if I want to make this square bigger and bigger and bigger over time,

3703
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:26,160
I'm going to have to change it in two

3704
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,459
different places and I've conjectured last time and today

3705
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:30,299
eventually that's going to come back and bite you.

3706
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:32,430
You're going to do something stupid or a colleague isn't

3707
02:11:32,430 --> 02:11:35,100
going to realize you hard coded 3 in multiple places,

3708
02:11:35,109 --> 02:11:36,700
like just bad design.

3709
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:38,430
So how could we fix this?

3710
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:38,779
Well,

3711
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:39,390
we could just.

3712
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:41,160
Declare a variable like n,

3713
02:11:41,209 --> 02:11:42,399
set it equal to 3,

3714
02:11:42,609 --> 02:11:44,790
and then use n in both places,

3715
02:11:44,799 --> 02:11:45,930
and that's pretty darn good.

3716
02:11:46,009 --> 02:11:48,720
That's better because now we are reusing the value,

3717
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:50,720
but we can do 1 better than this.

3718
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:53,520
It turns out in C and in many languages too,

3719
02:11:53,729 --> 02:11:56,129
there's the notion of a constant whereby if

3720
02:11:56,129 --> 02:11:57,850
you want to store something in a variable but

3721
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:59,649
you want to signal to the compiler that

3722
02:11:59,649 --> 02:12:02,000
this value should never change and better still,

3723
02:12:02,129 --> 02:12:03,560
you want to prevent yourself,

3724
02:12:03,810 --> 02:12:04,500
a human,

3725
02:12:04,729 --> 02:12:08,399
or Not to mention a colleague from accidentally changing this value,

3726
02:12:08,589 --> 02:12:11,509
you can declare it to be constant or constant for sure.

3727
02:12:11,669 --> 02:12:15,709
So if I go back into VS code on line 5 now and say constant,

3728
02:12:16,009 --> 02:12:19,549
that means that N is an integer that has a constant value.

3729
02:12:19,589 --> 02:12:23,459
So if I do something stupid later in my code and I try to set N equal to something else,

3730
02:12:23,709 --> 02:12:25,629
the compiler won't let me do that.

3731
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:27,740
It will protect me from myself,

3732
02:12:27,870 --> 02:12:30,660
so it's just a slightly better design

3733
02:12:31,029 --> 02:12:31,709
as well.

3734
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:33,779
All right,

3735
02:12:33,979 --> 02:12:34,810
questions

3736
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:36,560
on any of these here,

3737
02:12:37,299 --> 02:12:38,129
Mario.

3738
02:12:38,859 --> 02:12:41,770
Examples the first of our sort of real world problems,

3739
02:12:41,779 --> 02:12:44,080
albeit simplified textually.

3740
02:12:44,979 --> 02:12:45,359
All right,

3741
02:12:45,649 --> 02:12:50,640
let's focus lastly on things we can't really do well with computers,

3742
02:12:50,729 --> 02:12:51,029
uh,

3743
02:12:51,089 --> 02:12:53,049
namely some of the limitations thereof.

3744
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:56,060
So here is a cheat sheet of some of the operators we've seen thus far.

3745
02:12:56,089 --> 02:12:58,069
We played with these with comparison and,

3746
02:12:58,330 --> 02:12:58,680
uh,

3747
02:12:58,689 --> 02:12:59,200
doing some,

3748
02:12:59,250 --> 02:12:59,490
uh,

3749
02:12:59,529 --> 02:13:00,850
addition or the like,

3750
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:01,879
but here we have addition,

3751
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:02,990
subtraction multiplication,

3752
02:13:03,009 --> 02:13:03,560
division,

3753
02:13:03,770 --> 02:13:06,370
and the modulo operator which is essentially the remain.

3754
02:13:06,654 --> 02:13:07,194
operator,

3755
02:13:07,205 --> 02:13:10,875
which you can do with a single command with a single operator like this.

3756
02:13:10,964 --> 02:13:13,805
Let's use some of these to make our own calculator and

3757
02:13:13,805 --> 02:13:16,234
see what this calculator can and can't do for us.

3758
02:13:16,404 --> 02:13:17,404
So back here in VS code,

3759
02:13:17,444 --> 02:13:18,435
let me open my terminal.

3760
02:13:18,685 --> 02:13:21,645
Let's go ahead and create a program called Calculator.c.

3761
02:13:22,084 --> 02:13:22,935
And in this program,

3762
02:13:23,004 --> 02:13:24,964
let's do something super simple initially that

3763
02:13:24,964 --> 02:13:26,475
just like adds two numbers together.

3764
02:13:26,524 --> 02:13:28,365
So let's include first.

3765
02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:29,080
Uh,

3766
02:13:29,089 --> 02:13:31,370
CS 50.h so we can use our get functions.

3767
02:13:31,569 --> 02:13:34,439
Then let's go ahead and include standard IO.h so we can use print F.

3768
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:38,359
Let's just copy paste our usual in main void,

3769
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:39,370
and inside of Main,

3770
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:41,479
let's do this declare a variable X,

3771
02:13:41,649 --> 02:13:42,770
set it equal to get in,

3772
02:13:43,049 --> 02:13:45,799
and let's ask the user what's X question mark.

3773
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:47,950
Then let's declare another variable Y,

3774
02:13:48,089 --> 02:13:51,799
set it equal to get in and ask the user what's Y question mark.

3775
02:13:52,544 --> 02:13:55,294
Let's do something super simple like give me a third variable,

3776
02:13:55,464 --> 02:13:55,625
heck,

3777
02:13:55,665 --> 02:13:56,495
we'll call it Z,

3778
02:13:56,705 --> 02:13:59,015
set it equal to x + y,

3779
02:13:59,384 --> 02:14:00,064
and then lastly,

3780
02:14:00,145 --> 02:14:01,895
let's just print out the sum

3781
02:14:02,265 --> 02:14:03,214
of X + Y.

3782
02:14:03,325 --> 02:14:06,504
So this is a super simple calculator for addition of two numbers.

3783
02:14:06,625 --> 02:14:07,854
Print F quote unquote.

3784
02:14:08,345 --> 02:14:09,745
What's the answer going to be?

3785
02:14:09,944 --> 02:14:09,984
Well,

3786
02:14:10,024 --> 02:14:11,654
it's not pers.

3787
02:14:11,825 --> 02:14:13,584
This was quick earlier.

3788
02:14:13,665 --> 02:14:15,384
What's the placeholder to use for an integer?

3789
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:17,399
Percent I

3790
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:21,470
backslash N and what do I want to substitute for that placeholder?

3791
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:25,009
Just Z in this case we haven't quite done this before,

3792
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:27,979
but again it's just the composition of some of our earlier ideas.

3793
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:33,870
I can go ahead and make this calculator enter calculator enter what's X is 1,

3794
02:14:33,979 --> 02:14:35,089
what's Y is 2,

3795
02:14:35,299 --> 02:14:36,850
and indeed I get 3.

3796
02:14:36,939 --> 02:14:38,450
So not a bad calculator.

3797
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:40,049
It seems to be working correctly,

3798
02:14:40,459 --> 02:14:42,370
but it's maybe not the best design.

3799
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:44,490
Like it's generally frowned upon

3800
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:46,879
to create a variable like Z

3801
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:48,299
if you're only going to use it.

3802
02:14:48,443 --> 02:14:49,943
A moment later in one place,

3803
02:14:49,954 --> 02:14:53,664
like why are you wasting my time creating a variable just to use it once and only once?

3804
02:14:53,994 --> 02:14:56,624
Sometimes it's fine if it makes your code more readable or clearer,

3805
02:14:56,833 --> 02:14:58,844
and in fact it might if I called it sum.

3806
02:14:58,954 --> 02:15:01,604
Like that's arguably a net positive because I'm making clear

3807
02:15:01,604 --> 02:15:04,104
to the reader that it's the sum of two variables.

3808
02:15:04,153 --> 02:15:05,423
But even then I'm quibbling,

3809
02:15:05,594 --> 02:15:08,333
I could just get rid of that third variable altogether and heck,

3810
02:15:08,394 --> 02:15:10,034
I could just do X + Y right here.

3811
02:15:10,193 --> 02:15:11,954
That's totally fine and reasonable,

3812
02:15:12,074 --> 02:15:13,943
especially since it's still a pretty short line of code.

3813
02:15:13,994 --> 02:15:14,273
It's not.

3814
02:15:14,417 --> 02:15:16,998
Hard for anyone to read feels like a reasonable call,

3815
02:15:17,167 --> 02:15:19,958
but this hints at again my comment on design being subjective.

3816
02:15:20,208 --> 02:15:21,558
There's no steadfast rules here.

3817
02:15:21,768 --> 02:15:23,187
Some of the TAs might disagree with me,

3818
02:15:23,257 --> 02:15:23,598
but like,

3819
02:15:23,607 --> 02:15:23,757
ah,

3820
02:15:24,167 --> 02:15:24,877
this feels fine.

3821
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:25,607
It's readable,

3822
02:15:25,647 --> 02:15:27,877
which is probably the most important thing ultimately.

3823
02:15:28,047 --> 02:15:30,757
Let's make this calculator calculator.

3824
02:15:30,768 --> 02:15:32,578
E 12,

3825
02:15:32,768 --> 02:15:33,958
and we still get 3.

3826
02:15:34,087 --> 02:15:36,078
So the code now is still working.

3827
02:15:36,288 --> 02:15:36,868
As an aside,

3828
02:15:36,928 --> 02:15:39,127
if you're starting to wonder how I type so fast,

3829
02:15:39,328 --> 02:15:40,248
sometimes I'm kind of cheating.

3830
02:15:40,392 --> 02:15:41,691
With autocomplete.

3831
02:15:41,861 --> 02:15:44,691
So if I know I want to create a program called Calculator,

3832
02:15:44,731 --> 02:15:46,771
and Calculator.c exists,

3833
02:15:46,941 --> 02:15:49,901
I can start typing CAL tab

3834
02:15:50,301 --> 02:15:52,651
and you can hit tab to sort of autocomplete the rest

3835
02:15:52,651 --> 02:15:55,211
of the file name if it happens to exist there.

3836
02:15:55,381 --> 02:15:56,091
Better still,

3837
02:15:56,182 --> 02:15:58,341
if I want to go back to previous commands I've typed,

3838
02:15:58,381 --> 02:16:01,412
I can actually use my up and down errors to go through my history.

3839
02:16:01,582 --> 02:16:02,412
So if I go up,

3840
02:16:02,492 --> 02:16:02,611
up,

3841
02:16:02,622 --> 02:16:03,191
up,

3842
02:16:03,461 --> 02:16:05,262
you'll see all of the recent commands I typed,

3843
02:16:05,271 --> 02:16:06,262
and that saves me time.

3844
02:16:06,416 --> 02:16:09,775
2 so just little keyboard shortcuts that speed things along.

3845
02:16:10,155 --> 02:16:10,315
All right,

3846
02:16:10,436 --> 02:16:10,505
well,

3847
02:16:10,516 --> 02:16:11,465
let's do something like this,

3848
02:16:11,516 --> 02:16:12,386
not just addition.

3849
02:16:12,636 --> 02:16:14,315
Why don't we use some multiplication?

3850
02:16:14,436 --> 02:16:16,105
So how about we prompt the user,

3851
02:16:16,355 --> 02:16:17,726
not for two numbers,

3852
02:16:17,916 --> 02:16:19,746
but how about just 1 initially X,

3853
02:16:19,875 --> 02:16:22,545
and let's go ahead and multiply X by 2,

3854
02:16:22,675 --> 02:16:23,706
and I would do X,

3855
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:24,795
asterisk 2,

3856
02:16:24,875 --> 02:16:26,846
which is the multiplication operator in C.

3857
02:16:27,155 --> 02:16:30,266
Let's make this version of the calculator calculator,

3858
02:16:30,476 --> 02:16:31,395
and now what's X?

3859
02:16:31,425 --> 02:16:32,156
Let's do 1.

3860
02:16:32,690 --> 02:16:33,968
So 1 times 2 is 2.

3861
02:16:34,009 --> 02:16:34,690
Let's do this again.

3862
02:16:34,790 --> 02:16:36,888
Let's type in 22 times 2 is 4.

3863
02:16:36,968 --> 02:16:39,400
Let's do this again 33 times 2 is 6,

3864
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:40,280
and so forth.

3865
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:41,240
That's fine.

3866
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:41,959
It seems to work,

3867
02:16:42,089 --> 02:16:46,259
but maybe let's implement like a recent meme from the past year or two.

3868
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:47,330
How about this?

3869
02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:47,769
Let's,

3870
02:16:47,849 --> 02:16:47,910
uh,

3871
02:16:48,058 --> 02:16:50,000
let's see if you recognize it as we go.

3872
02:16:50,209 --> 02:16:52,459
So I'm going to get rid of this code altogether and inside of

3873
02:16:52,459 --> 02:16:57,120
my calculator I'm gonna do something like in dollars equals $1 by default.

3874
02:16:57,290 --> 02:16:58,650
Then I'm going to deliberately induce an

3875
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:00,610
infinite loop just for demonstration's sake.

3876
02:17:01,258 --> 02:17:02,128
Then I'm gonna do

3877
02:17:02,298 --> 02:17:03,928
a character from the user

3878
02:17:04,258 --> 02:17:06,689
and say something like this using get char,

3879
02:17:06,699 --> 02:17:08,208
which gets a single character.

3880
02:17:08,499 --> 02:17:08,939
Uh,

3881
02:17:09,018 --> 02:17:10,369
how about I'll tell the user,

3882
02:17:10,659 --> 02:17:13,548
here's this many dollars percent I

3883
02:17:13,779 --> 02:17:16,168
with the US dollar sign before it.

3884
02:17:16,708 --> 02:17:21,579
Double it and give to next person question mark if familiar with that one,

3885
02:17:21,708 --> 02:17:23,718
and I'm going to prompt them for a yes no answer,

3886
02:17:23,749 --> 02:17:25,148
but I'm going to plug in the current number

3887
02:17:25,148 --> 02:17:27,138
of dollars so they know what they're wagering on.

3888
02:17:27,388 --> 02:17:29,668
Then below this I'm going to say if the character

3889
02:17:29,668 --> 02:17:32,699
the human typed in equals equals Y for yes,

3890
02:17:32,989 --> 02:17:36,189
then I'm gonna go ahead and do dollars times equals 2,

3891
02:17:36,227 --> 02:17:38,378
which recall was our shorthand notation

3892
02:17:38,668 --> 02:17:40,428
for doubling something.

3893
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:40,980
Uh,

3894
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:41,769
in this case,

3895
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:44,750
I could more pedantically say equals dollars times 2,

3896
02:17:45,099 --> 02:17:49,820
but again I can say some keystrokes and dollar equals 2 instead.

3897
02:17:50,099 --> 02:17:50,870
There's no plus plus.

3898
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:52,259
There's no star star trick,

3899
02:17:52,299 --> 02:17:53,690
asterisk trick,

3900
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:56,330
you have to do it in this way minimally.

3901
02:17:56,540 --> 02:17:56,968
However,

3902
02:17:57,099 --> 02:17:59,660
if the user does not want to double it and give it to the next person,

3903
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:04,009
then let's do an L and just break out of this infinite loop altogether.

3904
02:18:04,259 --> 02:18:06,299
But notice what I've deliberately done in Getchar.

3905
02:18:07,234 --> 02:18:08,303
Similar to Print F,

3906
02:18:08,673 --> 02:18:10,523
I have included a placeholder.

3907
02:18:10,633 --> 02:18:14,914
Why we implemented GetHA and get in and get string just like Print

3908
02:18:14,914 --> 02:18:17,994
F and that you can pass in placeholders and plug in values.

3909
02:18:18,114 --> 02:18:18,513
Why?

3910
02:18:18,713 --> 02:18:18,773
Well,

3911
02:18:18,954 --> 02:18:19,143
again,

3912
02:18:19,193 --> 02:18:19,914
for the meme's sake,

3913
02:18:19,994 --> 02:18:23,183
I want to be able to tell the user how much money I'm about to hand them

3914
02:18:23,473 --> 02:18:24,393
when I ask them the question,

3915
02:18:24,433 --> 02:18:26,204
Do you want to double it and give it to the next person?

3916
02:18:26,234 --> 02:18:28,234
I want to see the number and the dollar

3917
02:18:28,234 --> 02:18:29,753
sign is just because we're talking about dollars.

3918
02:18:29,793 --> 02:18:32,114
The percent I is because we're talking about integers.

3919
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:32,929
All right,

3920
02:18:33,009 --> 02:18:33,888
if I didn't mess this up,

3921
02:18:33,968 --> 02:18:36,830
let's make this version of a calculator or meme.

3922
02:18:37,169 --> 02:18:37,490
So far,

3923
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:38,120
so good.

3924
02:18:38,929 --> 02:18:39,540
calculator,

3925
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:40,240
enter.

3926
02:18:40,519 --> 02:18:41,410
Here's $1

3927
02:18:41,570 --> 02:18:45,040
which was the initial value of my dollars variable on line 6.

3928
02:18:45,330 --> 02:18:46,839
Double it and give it to the next person.

3929
02:18:47,089 --> 02:18:47,330
All right,

3930
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:47,959
why?

3931
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:48,968
Here's $2.

3932
02:18:49,089 --> 02:18:50,519
Double it and give it to the next person.

3933
02:18:50,650 --> 02:18:51,240
OK.

3934
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:52,480
OK.

3935
02:18:52,808 --> 02:18:53,429
OK.

3936
02:18:54,009 --> 02:18:54,540
OK.

3937
02:18:55,049 --> 02:18:55,330
OK.

3938
02:18:55,410 --> 02:18:56,349
I'm going to do it faster.

3939
02:18:56,429 --> 02:18:57,519
It's getting pretty good.

3940
02:18:57,769 --> 02:18:59,650
You can see the power of exponentiation.

3941
02:19:01,189 --> 02:19:02,098
It's getting pretty high.

3942
02:19:02,159 --> 02:19:03,088
Let's keep going.

3943
02:19:03,378 --> 02:19:04,249
Keep going,

3944
02:19:05,018 --> 02:19:05,968
lot of dull,

3945
02:19:05,977 --> 02:19:07,058
mm mm,

3946
02:19:07,289 --> 02:19:08,008
too far.

3947
02:19:09,369 --> 02:19:11,058
That does not happen in the memes.

3948
02:19:11,308 --> 02:19:12,308
What happened here?

3949
02:19:13,549 --> 02:19:14,099
What's going on?

3950
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:14,259
Yeah,

3951
02:19:14,339 --> 02:19:14,929
what do you think?

3952
02:19:23,218 --> 02:19:25,619
Exactly good intuition because the computer only has a

3953
02:19:25,619 --> 02:19:27,818
finite number of bits allocated to each integer.

3954
02:19:27,898 --> 02:19:30,218
I hypothesized earlier that it's usually 32 bits,

3955
02:19:30,338 --> 02:19:31,428
maybe 64 bits,

3956
02:19:31,579 --> 02:19:32,689
but it's finite,

3957
02:19:32,939 --> 02:19:35,378
which means you can only count so high and it's roughly 4

3958
02:19:35,378 --> 02:19:38,409
billion or again an integer by default can be negative or positive.

3959
02:19:38,539 --> 02:19:39,779
So it's roughly 2 billion,

3960
02:19:39,789 --> 02:19:42,008
and that's pretty close to what we were getting here.

3961
02:19:42,098 --> 02:19:42,418
In fact,

3962
02:19:42,458 --> 02:19:44,648
we overflowed the integer

3963
02:19:44,859 --> 02:19:45,689
in memory.

3964
02:19:45,818 --> 02:19:46,189
In fact,

3965
02:19:46,338 --> 02:19:48,018
integer overflow is a term of art.

3966
02:19:48,156 --> 02:19:53,666
Whereby you can overflow an integer by trying to store too big of a value in it,

3967
02:19:53,675 --> 02:19:55,656
and the reason for this is again to make this clear,

3968
02:19:55,826 --> 02:19:59,975
this is a piece of memory inside of a laptop or a desktop or some other device,

3969
02:20:00,185 --> 02:20:02,505
and in these little black chips is a whole bunch

3970
02:20:02,505 --> 02:20:05,906
of bits or really bytes that can store information electronically,

3971
02:20:05,946 --> 02:20:08,196
but they allocate those bits in units of 8,

3972
02:20:08,385 --> 02:20:08,996
maybe 16,

3973
02:20:09,146 --> 02:20:09,786
maybe 32,

3974
02:20:09,896 --> 02:20:10,646
maybe 64,

3975
02:20:10,666 --> 02:20:13,055
but finitely many per value.

3976
02:20:13,242 --> 02:20:15,442
Whether we're using 32 or 64,

3977
02:20:15,572 --> 02:20:18,551
you can only count so high if you have a finite number of bits,

3978
02:20:18,631 --> 02:20:21,902
and we've seen this problem even on a small scale with our flat light bulbs last week.

3979
02:20:22,032 --> 02:20:25,032
If we have a 3 digit number as represented by like

3980
02:20:25,032 --> 02:20:28,141
3 physical light bulbs or 3 tiny transistors in the computer,

3981
02:20:28,311 --> 02:20:34,541
I can count from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 to 7.

3982
02:20:34,751 --> 02:20:36,421
If I want to count to 8 though,

3983
02:20:36,711 --> 02:20:38,171
I need a 4th bit.

3984
02:20:38,618 --> 02:20:40,227
But as the red suggests,

3985
02:20:40,278 --> 02:20:41,717
if you don't have a 4th bit,

3986
02:20:41,917 --> 02:20:43,257
for all intents and purposes,

3987
02:20:43,398 --> 02:20:45,408
that number is just 0.

3988
02:20:45,677 --> 02:20:46,597
Or as an aside,

3989
02:20:46,797 --> 02:20:48,398
depending on how you're representing your numbers,

3990
02:20:48,797 --> 02:20:50,448
sometimes a leading one indicates that

3991
02:20:50,667 --> 02:20:52,667
the number itself is negative,

3992
02:20:52,797 --> 02:20:55,198
which is why in VS code we actually saw both symptoms.

3993
02:20:55,297 --> 02:20:58,477
First we went negative because we wrapped around logically,

3994
02:20:58,677 --> 02:21:02,297
much like that 1 resulted in our getting back effectively to zero,

3995
02:21:02,837 --> 02:21:03,318
and then we did.

3996
02:21:03,414 --> 02:21:06,253
Indeed end up on 0 ultimately.

3997
02:21:06,444 --> 02:21:07,683
So how can we chip away at this?

3998
02:21:07,803 --> 02:21:07,904
Well,

3999
02:21:08,053 --> 02:21:09,553
a couple of solutions perhaps.

4000
02:21:09,723 --> 02:21:12,704
Let me close my terminal window here and instead of using an in,

4001
02:21:12,883 --> 02:21:13,274
well,

4002
02:21:13,404 --> 02:21:14,723
let's just kick the can down the road.

4003
02:21:14,763 --> 02:21:15,534
Let's use a long,

4004
02:21:15,603 --> 02:21:16,824
which is 64 bits.

4005
02:21:16,923 --> 02:21:19,433
So at least we can give away even more money in this scenario.

4006
02:21:19,643 --> 02:21:23,593
I can't use percent I I need to use LI now for a long integer,

4007
02:21:23,923 --> 02:21:25,553
but I think at this point,

4008
02:21:25,763 --> 02:21:28,553
if I go back to VS Code's terminal window here,

4009
02:21:28,933 --> 02:21:31,404
or when I quit that program by hitting control C quickly.

4010
02:21:31,799 --> 02:21:32,070
Uh,

4011
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:36,009
now I'm going to go ahead and do make calculator again calculator,

4012
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:37,839
and I'm just going to keep hitting Y.

4013
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:42,259
But because I'm using a long in now and thus 64 bits,

4014
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:43,629
if I do this long enough,

4015
02:21:43,679 --> 02:21:45,549
it's going to get crazy high

4016
02:21:45,879 --> 02:21:46,309
and much,

4017
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:47,559
much higher than before,

4018
02:21:47,599 --> 02:21:49,280
high enough that I'm not going to keep clicking Y

4019
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,839
enter because we're never going to hit the boundary,

4020
02:21:50,879 --> 02:21:51,610
but eventually,

4021
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:54,110
especially if I did this in a loop automatically,

4022
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,070
it would certainly,

4023
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,440
00.

4024
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:57,169
OK,

4025
02:21:57,250 --> 02:21:58,719
I guess exponentiation works fast.

4026
02:21:58,889 --> 02:21:59,049
OK,

4027
02:21:59,169 --> 02:21:59,650
so it did work.

4028
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:01,000
I didn't think I was going to hit it enough times,

4029
02:22:01,209 --> 02:22:02,519
but the same problem happened again.

4030
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:04,080
We overflowed this

4031
02:22:04,410 --> 02:22:05,250
long integer,

4032
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:08,330
even using that many bits because I was talking so long I

4033
02:22:08,330 --> 02:22:11,620
kept hitting Y enough times to overflow even that long integer.

4034
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:13,000
So that too was a problem,

4035
02:22:13,009 --> 02:22:14,799
and this happens truly in the real world.

4036
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:17,889
So picture here is a Boeing 787 from a few years back,

4037
02:22:18,009 --> 02:22:19,889
long before there were all the more recent problems with.

4038
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:22,360
planes whereby after

4039
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:26,309
248 days of continuous power,

4040
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:29,299
which is kind of a thing in the aviation industry like time is money,

4041
02:22:29,429 --> 02:22:31,769
and generally they want the planes in the air as much as possible,

4042
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:33,900
which means they want them powered on as much as possible,

4043
02:22:34,030 --> 02:22:35,589
which means they don't like turn them off at night.

4044
02:22:35,669 --> 02:22:37,219
They keep them going and flying.

4045
02:22:37,469 --> 02:22:39,379
After 248 days,

4046
02:22:39,509 --> 02:22:43,110
the New York Times reported a few years back that a Model 787 airplane.

4047
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:48,820
That has been powered continuously for 248 days can lose all alternating current

4048
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:50,860
electrical power due to the generator control

4049
02:22:50,860 --> 02:22:53,049
unit simultaneously going into fail-safe mode.

4050
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,830
This condition is caused by a software counter internal to the

4051
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:59,290
GCUs that will overflow after 248 days of continuous power.

4052
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:03,259
Boeing is in the process at the time of developing a GCU software upgrade.

4053
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:03,980
Will remedy

4054
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:05,259
the unsafe condition.

4055
02:23:05,429 --> 02:23:09,429
So literally what this means is that the power to these planes would just shut

4056
02:23:09,429 --> 02:23:13,519
off if the planes were on for more than 248 days at a time,

4057
02:23:13,549 --> 02:23:17,339
and this was a common thing for lanes to be maximal power.

4058
02:23:17,870 --> 02:23:20,469
Why was this actually happening or what was the solution?

4059
02:23:20,549 --> 02:23:20,589
Well,

4060
02:23:20,629 --> 02:23:21,429
the short term fix,

4061
02:23:21,509 --> 02:23:23,219
because it took a while for Boeing to fix this,

4062
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:24,549
was what?

4063
02:23:24,669 --> 02:23:27,179
What would you do if the symptom is that the plane

4064
02:23:27,709 --> 02:23:30,219
shuts off midflight after 248 days,

4065
02:23:30,309 --> 02:23:30,780
yeah.

4066
02:23:32,419 --> 02:23:34,820
Literally turn it off and back on again,

4067
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:37,559
much like you've probably been taught with your phones and computers

4068
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:40,570
and any other electronic devices that somehow freak out on occasion.

4069
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:41,620
Reboot the plane.

4070
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:42,580
Now why is that?

4071
02:23:42,700 --> 02:23:42,740
Well,

4072
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:45,900
any time you reboot a phone or a laptop or a plane,

4073
02:23:46,219 --> 02:23:49,620
all of those variables get reset to their default values,

4074
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:49,809
which,

4075
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:50,980
if it's the first line of code,

4076
02:23:51,059 --> 02:23:52,059
like in some of my examples,

4077
02:23:52,139 --> 02:23:53,900
get set back to zero again.

4078
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:54,620
For instance,

4079
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:57,530
the first line of code is executed from top to bottom.

4080
02:23:57,759 --> 02:23:59,139
So this effectively solved the.

4081
02:23:59,224 --> 02:23:59,455
Problem.

4082
02:23:59,535 --> 02:24:00,974
But when they finally rolled out a fix,

4083
02:24:01,054 --> 02:24:02,294
then you didn't have to do that anymore.

4084
02:24:02,334 --> 02:24:04,655
But the source of the problem is essentially

4085
02:24:04,655 --> 02:24:07,365
that they were probably using 32 bit integers,

4086
02:24:07,375 --> 02:24:08,415
but also negative value,

4087
02:24:08,495 --> 02:24:12,415
so they had 31 bits at their disposal to count to positive numbers,

4088
02:24:12,445 --> 02:24:18,285
and 248 days is roughly how many tens of a second there are,

4089
02:24:18,535 --> 02:24:22,565
which means once you count in tens of a second for 248 days

4090
02:24:22,565 --> 02:24:26,254
you would overflow an integer and the power would shut off effectively because.

4091
02:24:26,389 --> 02:24:28,309
Something ended up going to zero,

4092
02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:29,719
so there was a lot of sort of

4093
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:31,730
marketing speak or technical speak in that,

4094
02:24:31,769 --> 02:24:34,639
but it boiled down to just a simple integer overflow.

4095
02:24:34,809 --> 02:24:37,290
There's a historical bug in Pac-Man if you've

4096
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:40,269
ever played this in any of its forms whereby

4097
02:24:40,490 --> 02:24:43,240
you can play up to level 255,

4098
02:24:43,330 --> 02:24:46,599
but because there was a missing if condition that checked what level you were on,

4099
02:24:46,730 --> 02:24:50,400
you could accidentally garble the screen if you were amazing at Pac-Man

4100
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:53,410
because they too would overflow an integer and just random character.

4101
02:24:53,655 --> 02:24:54,995
would end up appearing on the screen,

4102
02:24:55,165 --> 02:24:57,125
so it's sort of like a badge of honor to actually

4103
02:24:57,125 --> 02:25:00,674
hit level 256 in this way because of this bug.

4104
02:25:01,004 --> 02:25:02,855
But there's yet other issues we can see here,

4105
02:25:02,875 --> 02:25:03,445
and if you don't mind,

4106
02:25:03,455 --> 02:25:04,955
we might go a couple minutes over,

4107
02:25:05,044 --> 02:25:06,384
but let me just demonstrate

4108
02:25:06,684 --> 02:25:08,875
what these examples can do for us here.

4109
02:25:09,044 --> 02:25:12,365
If I were to revamp my calculator here as follows by

4110
02:25:12,365 --> 02:25:15,315
clearing my terminal window after hitting control C to kill that,

4111
02:25:15,525 --> 02:25:18,334
let me go ahead and get rid of all of this meme code here,

4112
02:25:18,605 --> 02:25:20,525
scrolling down to the inside of main.

4113
02:25:20,969 --> 02:25:23,080
And let's just do a couple of things like this

4114
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:29,110
in X equals quote unquote uh what's X question mark.

4115
02:25:29,360 --> 02:25:34,549
Then let's go ahead and do in Y equals get in quote unquote what'sy question mark.

4116
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:37,330
Then let's go ahead and print out just X divided by Y.

4117
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:41,110
So here's a percent I backslash N X divided by Y.

4118
02:25:41,599 --> 02:25:43,750
This would seem to be a calculator now for division,

4119
02:25:43,839 --> 02:25:45,370
which I can make as before.

4120
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:47,230
And actually,

4121
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:47,969
sorry,

4122
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:51,110
I don't want to do the missing terminating,

4123
02:25:51,309 --> 02:25:51,440
oh,

4124
02:25:51,559 --> 02:25:51,950
sorry,

4125
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:54,559
missing a double quote there was an unintended bug.

4126
02:25:54,639 --> 02:25:54,750
So,

4127
02:25:54,759 --> 02:25:55,910
if I make this here calculator,

4128
02:25:55,959 --> 02:25:57,110
do slash calculator,

4129
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:57,759
type in 1,

4130
02:25:57,839 --> 02:25:58,589
type in 3.

4131
02:25:59,000 --> 02:25:59,990
I get 0,

4132
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:01,019
which is weird.

4133
02:26:01,269 --> 02:26:04,059
What if I do instead maybe 2 and 3?

4134
02:26:04,269 --> 02:26:06,309
It's 0 instead of 0.66.

4135
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:07,740
What if I do 3 and 3?

4136
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:07,870
Well,

4137
02:26:07,950 --> 02:26:09,179
that curiously works,

4138
02:26:09,269 --> 02:26:10,910
but if I do something like 4 and 3,

4139
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:12,790
which would be 1.33,

4140
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:15,080
that 2 doesn't seem to work.

4141
02:26:15,230 --> 02:26:17,110
So there's this other issue in computing when

4142
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:18,709
you have finite numbers of bits known as

4143
02:26:18,709 --> 02:26:21,349
truncation whereby even when you're trying to do

4144
02:26:21,349 --> 02:26:23,950
floating point math like with a decimal point,

4145
02:26:24,309 --> 02:26:26,219
if you are using an integer,

4146
02:26:26,379 --> 02:26:26,750
you're going to.

4147
02:26:26,901 --> 02:26:30,250
Throw away everything after the decimal point unless

4148
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:32,600
you're explicitly using the right data type,

4149
02:26:32,731 --> 02:26:34,680
and we saw an allusion to this earlier.

4150
02:26:34,850 --> 02:26:38,970
If I actually go in now and change my values from integers to floats

4151
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:43,081
and change the percent I to a percent F and remake this calculator,

4152
02:26:43,291 --> 02:26:47,310
now I can do 1 divided by 3 and I actually get back that their response.

4153
02:26:47,571 --> 02:26:51,130
But there's another issue latent here which happens to in the real world

4154
02:26:51,130 --> 02:26:54,090
whereby I'm going to tweak this percent F to be a little arcane.

4155
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:54,741
It turns out.

4156
02:26:54,801 --> 02:26:59,072
You can see how many digits you want to show how many significant digits you want,

4157
02:26:59,122 --> 02:26:59,662
if you will,

4158
02:26:59,952 --> 02:27:03,181
by just using a dot and then a number like 50 arbitrarily.

4159
02:27:03,391 --> 02:27:05,551
And contrary to what you might have learned in grade school,

4160
02:27:05,652 --> 02:27:07,421
this calculator would seem to think

4161
02:27:07,751 --> 02:27:10,942
that calculator 1 divided by 3

4162
02:27:11,272 --> 02:27:15,181
is not 0.33333333 infinitely many times.

4163
02:27:15,311 --> 02:27:18,022
There's all this random stuff happening at the end.

4164
02:27:18,311 --> 02:27:19,112
Long story short,

4165
02:27:19,192 --> 02:27:22,591
this is because computers one only use finitely many bits even.

4166
02:27:22,703 --> 02:27:25,613
To represent floating point numbers and if there's an infinite number of those,

4167
02:27:25,733 --> 02:27:28,962
you can't possibly represent every possible floating point value.

4168
02:27:29,092 --> 02:27:32,792
So we're essentially seeing an approximation of 1/3 precisely,

4169
02:27:32,892 --> 02:27:35,323
but this too happens quite a bit in the wild.

4170
02:27:35,533 --> 02:27:38,212
There's really no solution to this other than by throwing more

4171
02:27:38,212 --> 02:27:41,323
bits at the problem using a double instead of a flow,

4172
02:27:41,533 --> 02:27:44,623
or at least somehow trying to detect this and catch this.

4173
02:27:44,852 --> 02:27:47,403
That then is what we'd call floating point imprecision.

4174
02:27:47,453 --> 02:27:50,533
But to tie this together and sort of induce a bit of fear and for the coming years.

4175
02:27:50,954 --> 02:27:52,513
These things happen all of the time.

4176
02:27:52,553 --> 02:27:53,683
Back when I was finishing school,

4177
02:27:53,753 --> 02:27:57,574
there was the so-called Y2K problem or year 2000 problem whereby

4178
02:27:57,793 --> 02:28:00,994
for decades computers had been using not 4 digits to

4179
02:28:00,994 --> 02:28:03,463
represent years but just two because it was convenient,

4180
02:28:03,713 --> 02:28:06,353
it was more efficient because you use half as much memory to

4181
02:28:06,353 --> 02:28:09,944
represent maybe the year 1999 just using two digits instead of 4.

4182
02:28:10,154 --> 02:28:15,343
Of course when the year rolled around from 1999 to 2000,

4183
02:28:15,353 --> 02:28:17,574
if you didn't have these numbers even in memory,

4184
02:28:17,753 --> 02:28:18,343
you might confuse.

4185
02:28:18,894 --> 02:28:21,405
2000 with 1900,

4186
02:28:21,495 --> 02:28:23,964
which was the presumption if you're only storing two digits.

4187
02:28:24,075 --> 02:28:26,134
So we screwed that up and thankfully the world scrambled,

4188
02:28:26,144 --> 02:28:28,214
and if you read up on Wikipedia and news articles from

4189
02:28:28,214 --> 02:28:30,464
the time everyone thought the world might very well end,

4190
02:28:30,884 --> 02:28:31,644
but it didn't,

4191
02:28:31,775 --> 02:28:33,485
so you'd think we'd learned our lesson.

4192
02:28:33,695 --> 02:28:34,214
Unfortunately,

4193
02:28:34,334 --> 02:28:37,325
another such problem is coming up in the year 2038,

4194
02:28:37,415 --> 02:28:40,724
whereby historically since the 70s and prior,

4195
02:28:41,214 --> 02:28:44,905
computers have generally used 32 bit integers to keep track of time,

4196
02:28:45,044 --> 02:28:46,254
the date and the time.

4197
02:28:46,406 --> 02:28:50,066
By means of counting how many seconds have passed since January 1st,

4198
02:28:50,236 --> 02:28:51,585
1970,

4199
02:28:51,595 --> 02:28:53,795
and all of the math is just relative to that date because

4200
02:28:53,795 --> 02:28:56,396
that's when computers were really starting to come onto the scene,

4201
02:28:56,475 --> 02:28:57,026
if you will.

4202
02:28:57,225 --> 02:28:57,835
Unfortunately,

4203
02:28:57,916 --> 02:29:00,835
there's only 4 billion values you can count to or

4204
02:29:00,835 --> 02:29:03,036
2 billion if you're doing negatives from January 1st,

4205
02:29:03,625 --> 02:29:05,225
1970.

4206
02:29:05,236 --> 02:29:05,946
And so,

4207
02:29:06,396 --> 02:29:06,576
um,

4208
02:29:06,616 --> 02:29:08,446
on the date January 19th,

4209
02:29:08,515 --> 02:29:09,706
2038,

4210
02:29:10,036 --> 02:29:14,196
we will overflow a 32 bit counter and suddenly if this problem is not.

4211
02:29:14,306 --> 02:29:17,466
Fixed by you or other people before the year 2038,

4212
02:29:17,617 --> 02:29:21,926
our computers and phones and other devices may very well think it's December 13,

4213
02:29:22,296 --> 02:29:23,976
1901.

4214
02:29:24,457 --> 02:29:24,926
