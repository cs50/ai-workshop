0
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:43,729
All

1
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:44,889
right,

2
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,630
this is CS 50,

3
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,560
and this is our lecture on artificial intelligence or AI,

4
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,830
particularly for all of those family members who are here

5
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,459
in the audience with us for the first time.

6
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,869
In fact,

7
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,110
uh,

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,180
for those students among us,

9
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,430
maybe a round of applause for all of the family

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,869
members who have come here today to join you.

11
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:00,639
Nice.

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,340
So nice to see everyone.

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,279
And as CS 50 students already know,

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,529
it's sort of a thing in programming circles to have a rubber duck on your desk.

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:09,769
Indeed,

16
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,410
a few weeks back we gave one to all CS 50 students,

17
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,360
and the motivation is to have someone,

18
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,489
something to talk to in the presence of a bug or mistake in

19
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,050
your code or confusion you're having when it comes to solving some problem.

20
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,230
And the idea is that

21
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,720
in the absence of having a friend,

22
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:24,459
family member,

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,599
TA of whom you can ask questions is to literally verbalize your confusion,

24
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:29,610
your question to this.

25
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,339
object on your desk and in that process

26
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:34,779
of verbalizing your own confusion and explaining yourself,

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,620
quite often does that proverbial light bulb go off over your head and voila,

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,870
problem is solved.

29
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,739
Now as CS50 students also know,

30
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:46,000
we sort of virtualized that rubber duck over the past few years and most recently

31
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,339
in a form of this guy here.

32
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,269
So in student's programming environment within CS 50,

33
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:55,339
a tool called Visual Studio Code at a URL of CS50.dv,

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,440
they have a virtual rubber duck available at available to them at all times.

35
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,690
And early on

36
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,709
in the very first version of this rubber duck,

37
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,889
it was a chat window that looked like this and if students had a question,

38
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,119
they could simply type into the chat window something like,

39
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm hoping you can help me solve a problem.

40
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,479
And for multiple years,

41
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,199
all the CS 50 duck did

42
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,380
was respond with 12 or 3 quacks.

43
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,809
We have anecdotal evidence to suggest that that

44
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:21,410
alone was enough for answering students' questions because

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,089
it was in that process of like actually typing out the confusion that you realize,

46
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:25,580
oh,

47
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:25,889
I'm.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,990
Doing something silly and you figure it out on your own.

49
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:32,669
But of course now that we live in an age of chat GBT and Claude and

50
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:38,059
Gemini and all of these other AI based tools came as no surprise perhaps when in 2023

51
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,669
the same duck started responding to students in English and

52
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,429
that now is the tool that they have available,

53
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,830
which is in effect meant to be a less helpful version of Chat GPT,

54
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:48,699
one that doesn't just spoil answers outright,

55
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:53,009
but tries to guide them to solutions akin to any good teacher or tutor.

56
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,009
And so today's

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,089
is indeed on just that and the underlying building blocks that make possible that

58
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:02,080
they're rubber duck in all of the AI with which we're all increasingly familiar,

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,899
namely generative artificial intelligence using this technology known as AI

60
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:07,520
to generate something,

61
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,330
whether that's images or sounds or video or text.

62
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:11,729
And in fact,

63
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,960
what we thought we'd do to get everyone involved early on is if you have a phone

64
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,039
by your side,

65
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,720
if you'd like to go ahead and scan this QR QR code here,

66
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,059
and that's going to lead you.

67
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,470
To a polling station where you can buzz in with some answers.

68
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,500
CS 50's preceptor Kelly is going to kindly join

69
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,779
me here on stage to help run the keyboard,

70
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,190
and what we're about to do is play a little game and

71
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,100
see just how good we humans are right now at distinguishing AI from

72
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:37,990
reality.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,649
And so we'll borrow some data from The New York Times,

74
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,669
which a couple of years back actually published some examples of AI and not AI,

75
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,949
and we'll see just how good this this technology has gotten.

76
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:50,070
So here we have two photographs on the screen.

77
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,990
In a moment,

78
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:54,339
you'll be asked on your phone if you were successful in scanning that code,

79
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,539
which one of these is AI?

80
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,339
Left or right?

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,339
So hopefully on your phone here,

82
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,050
if you want to go ahead and swipe to the next screen,

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,610
we'll activate the pole here.

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,979
In a moment you should see on your phone a prompt

85
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,529
inviting you to select left

86
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:11,589
or

87
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:12,649
right.

88
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:15,160
And

89
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,059
Feel free to raise your hand if you're not seeing that,

90
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,910
but it looks like the responses are coming in,

91
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:22,070
and at the risk of spoiling,

92
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,589
it looks like 70%+ of you think it is the answer on the right.

93
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,149
And if Kelly,

94
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,059
maybe we could swipe back to the two photographs in this particular case,

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,600
yes,

96
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,470
it was in fact the one on the right,

97
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:31,709
maybe.

98
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,315
Looked a little too good or maybe a little too unreal,

99
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:36,625
maybe let's see,

100
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,875
maybe a couple of other examples.

101
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:38,704
So same QR code,

102
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:39,725
no need to re-scan.

103
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:42,524
Let's go ahead and pull up these two examples now 2 photographs,

104
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:43,394
same question.

105
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,375
Which of these is AI?

106
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,255
Left

107
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:47,334
or right?

108
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,950
Left

109
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,459
Or right

110
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,130
Alright,

111
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,730
I want to take a look at the chart,

112
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:57,459
see what the responses are coming in a little closer in this case,

113
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,410
but a majority of you think the answer is in fact left here,

114
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,320
though 5% of you are truthfully admitting that you're unsure.

115
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,760
But Kelly,

116
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,109
if you want to swipe back to the photos,

117
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,239
the answer this time was in fact a trick question.

118
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,640
They were both in fact AI,

119
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,070
which

120
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,880
perhaps speaks to just how good this technology is already getting.

121
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Neither of these faces exists in the real world.

122
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,160
It was synthesized based on lots of training data,

123
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,970
so two photographs that look like humans but do not in fact exist.

124
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,250
How about one more this time focusing on text,

125
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,769
which will be the focus of course underlying our duck.

126
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,220
Did a 4th grader write this or the new chatbot?

127
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,010
Here are two final examples same code as before,

128
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,160
so no need to re-scan.

129
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,890
And here are the texts.

130
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,049
SA 1 I'd like to bring a yummy sandwich and a cold juice box for lunch.

131
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:43,299
Sometimes I'll even pack a tasty piece of fruit or a bag of crunchy chips.

132
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:43,850
As we eat,

133
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,059
we chat and laugh and catch up on each other's day.

134
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,980
SA 2.

135
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,260
My mother packs me a sandwich,

136
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:49,670
a drink,

137
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:49,970
fruit,

138
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,480
and a treat.

139
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,690
When I get into a lunchroom,

140
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:54,609
I find an empty table and sit there and eat my lunch.

141
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,329
My friends come and sit down with me.

142
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,649
The question now lastly is which of these is AI?

143
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,059
1 or 2?

144
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,140
SA 1

145
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,440
or 2.

146
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,369
The bars here are duking themselves out.

147
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,130
Looks like a majority of you say SA 1.

148
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,929
Let's go back to the text and some of you who,

149
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,160
one of you who says SA 1 Y if you want to raise a quick hand,

150
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,209
why SA 1,

151
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,529
yeah.

152
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,570
OK,

153
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,880
and uh it's so SA2 looks more like you would write and kind of ask what grade you are in?

154
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:24,649
A 5th grader.

155
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,279
So is this a new 5th grader or not?

156
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,100
The answer here,

157
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,839
in fact,

158
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:35,200
is that SA 1 is the AI because indeed SA 2 is more akin to what a 4th,

159
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:35,839
or if I may,

160
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,049
a 5th grader would write.

161
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:39,369
And I dare say there are maybe some telltale signs.

162
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,970
I'm not sure a typical 4th grader or 5th grader would catch up

163
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,450
on each other's day in the vernacular that we see in SA 1.

164
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,690
But suffice it to say this game is not something we can play for in the

165
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,649
years to come because it's just going to get too hard to discern something that's a.

166
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:54,993
I generated or not.

167
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:58,694
And so among our goals for today is really to give you a better sense of not just

168
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,473
how technologies like this duck and these games that

169
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:02,324
we've played here with images and text work,

170
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:05,174
but really what are the underlying principles of artificial

171
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,773
intelligence that frankly have been with us and have been

172
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:10,294
developing for decades and have really now come to a

173
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:13,384
head in recent years thanks to advances in research,

174
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,164
thanks to all the more cloud computing,

175
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:19,273
thanks to all the more memory and disk space and information,

176
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:19,614
sheer.

177
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,997
The volume thereof that we have at our disposal that

178
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,917
can be used to train all of these here technologies.

179
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:29,197
So that their duck is built on a fairly complicated architecture that looks a

180
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,477
little something like this where here's a student using one of CS 50's tools.

181
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:36,458
Here's a website with which CS 50 students are familiar called CS50.AI where we,

182
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:36,838
the staff,

183
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:40,798
wrote a bunch of code that actually talks to what are called APIs,

184
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,477
application programming interfaces,

185
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:45,567
third party services by companies like Microsoft and OpenAI.

186
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,022
Really have been doing the hard work of developing

187
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,111
these models as well as some local sweets,

188
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,532
some local sauce that we CS 50 add into the mix to make it specific,

189
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,812
the duck's answers to CS50 itself.

190
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,182
But what we've essentially been doing is something that

191
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:01,092
with which you might be familiar in part,

192
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,062
prompt engineering,

193
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,421
which has started popping up for better

194
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:06,252
or for worse on LinkedIn profiles everywhere,

195
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,731
and prompt engineering really,

196
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:11,742
it's not so much a form of engineering as it is a form of asking good questions.

197
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:16,756
And being detailed in your question giving context to the underlying AI

198
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:19,716
so that the answer with high probability is what you want back.

199
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:21,605
And so there's two terms in this world

200
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:23,596
of prompt engineering that are worth knowing about.

201
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:26,656
So in CS 50 has leveraged both of these to implement that duck.

202
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,885
We for instance wrote what's called a system prompt,

203
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,726
which are instructions written by us humans,

204
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:31,835
often in English,

205
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:35,125
that sort of nudge the underlying AI technology to

206
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,726
have a certain personality or a specific domain.

207
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,070
Of expertise.

208
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,058
For instance,

209
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,729
we CS 50 have written a system prompt essentially that looks like this.

210
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,179
In reality it's like a lot of lines long nowadays,

211
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,369
but the essence of it

212
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,130
is this.

213
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,820
You are a friendly and supportive teaching assistant for CS 50.

214
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,369
You are also a rubber duck,

215
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,500
and that is sufficient to turn an AI into a rubber duck.

216
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,059
It turns out.

217
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,349
Answer student questions only about CS 50 in the field of computer science.

218
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,460
Do not answer questions about unrelated topics.

219
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:06,419
Do not provide full answers to problem sets as this would violate academic honesty.

220
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,169
Answer this question colon.

221
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,330
And after that

222
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,179
preamble,

223
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,700
if you will,

224
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,010
aka system prompt,

225
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,390
we effectively copy paste whatever question a student has typed in,

226
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,419
otherwise known as a user prompt,

227
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,200
and that is why the duck behaves like a duck in our case and not a cat or a dog.

228
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:22,377
Or a PhD,

229
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:24,536
but rather something that's been attenuated to the

230
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,956
particular goals we have pedagogically in the course.

231
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:27,677
And in fact,

232
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,937
those of you who are CS 50 students

233
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:33,276
might recall from quite some weeks ago in week zero

234
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:36,956
when we first introduced the course to the class,

235
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,356
we had code that we whipped up that day

236
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,716
that ultimately looked a little something like this,

237
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,726
and I'll walk through it briefly line by line,

238
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:47,137
but now on the heels of having studied some Python in CS 50,

239
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:51,086
this year code that I whipped up in the first lecture might make now a bit more sense.

240
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,114
In that first lecture,

241
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,713
we imported OpenAI's own library code that a third party

242
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:58,564
company wrote to make it possible for us to implement

243
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,073
code on top of theirs.

244
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:02,393
We created a variable called client in week zero,

245
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,794
and this gave us access to the OpenAI client,

246
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,583
that is software that they wrote for us.

247
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:09,674
We then defined in week zero a user prompt which came from the

248
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:12,943
user using the input function with which CS 50 students are now familiar,

249
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,013
and then we defined this system prompt that day

250
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,073
where I said limit your answer to one sentence,

251
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,234
pretend you're a cat,

252
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,783
I think was the persona of the day.

253
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,541
And then we used some bit more arcane code here,

254
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:26,450
but in essence we created a variable called response which

255
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,971
was meant to represent the response from OpenAI Server.

256
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,301
We used client.responses.create,

257
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,620
which is a function or method that OpenAI gives us that allows

258
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,731
us to pass in three arguments the input from the user,

259
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:38,971
that is the user prompt,

260
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,700
the instructions from us,

261
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,971
that is the system prompt,

262
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,651
and then the specific model or version of AI that we wanted to use.

263
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,671
And the last thing we did that day was print out response.

264
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,421
output_text.

265
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:54,877
That's how we were able to answer questions like what is CS 50 or the like.

266
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,877
So we've seen all of that before,

267
00:10:56,968 --> 00:11:00,328
but we didn't talk about that week exactly how it was

268
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,677
working or what more we could actually do with it.

269
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,867
And so in fact what I thought we'd do today

270
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,038
is peel back a layer that we've not allowed into

271
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:09,357
the course up until now and indeed you still cannot

272
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,598
use this feature until the very end of the class

273
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,857
in CS 50 when you get to your final projects,

274
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:19,197
at which point you are welcome and encouraged to use VS code in this particular way.

275
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:20,208
So here again is.

276
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,474
Code for those unfamiliar,

277
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,085
this is the programming environment we use here with students.

278
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:27,554
And let me open up some code that was assigned to students a couple of weeks back,

279
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:31,174
namely a spell checker that they had to implement in C.

280
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:33,905
So I came in advance with a folder called speller,

281
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:38,065
and inside of this folder I had code that day and all students had that week

282
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,515
called dictionary.c.

283
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:40,864
And in this file,

284
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,794
which will not look familiar to many of you if

285
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:46,344
you've not taken week 0 through 7 up until now,

286
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,515
we did have some placeholders for students.

287
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:49,594
So long story short,

288
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,671
had to answer a few questions,

289
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,062
that is,

290
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,192
write code to do this to do this to do this to do,

291
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:55,981
and one more.

292
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:59,731
There were 4 functions or blanks that students needed to fill in with code,

293
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,062
and I dare say it took most students

294
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,252
5 hours,

295
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,341
10 hours,

296
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:05,661
15 hours,

297
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:07,812
something in that very broad range.

298
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,742
Let me show you now how using AI

299
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:15,221
you soon the aspiring programmers can start to write code all the more quickly,

300
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,971
not by just choosing a different language,

301
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:19,702
but by using these AI based technologies.

302
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,369
beyond the duck itself.

303
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:24,809
So what I've done here on the right hand side of VS Code is enabled the

304
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:27,328
feature that CS50 disables for all students from

305
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,169
the start of the course called copilot.

306
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,888
This is very similar in spirit to products from

307
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:33,968
Google and Anthropic and other companies as well,

308
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,838
but this is the one that comes from Microsoft and in turned GitHub here,

309
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,838
and it too gives us me sort of a chat window here and this is just one of its features.

310
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:41,489
For instance,

311
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:45,039
if I wanted to implement to get started the check function,

312
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,568
I could just ask it to do that.

313
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:47,638
Ilement

314
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,408
the check function.

315
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:50,580
And

316
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,940
uh how about using a hash table in C?

317
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:56,729
I'm going to go ahead and click Enter.

318
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,280
Now it's going to work.

319
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,760
It's using as reference,

320
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,780
that is context,

321
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,239
the very file that I've opened,

322
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,989
which is dictionary.c here.

323
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,510
Co-pilot in general,

324
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,219
as well as a lot of AI tools are familiar with CS50

325
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,869
itself because it's been freely available as open courseware for years.

326
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,789
What you see

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,309
here doing is essentially thinking,

328
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,559
though that's a bit of an overstatement.

329
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,669
It's not really thinking,

330
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,599
it's trying to find patterns in what the problem is I

331
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,400
want to solve among all of its training data that it's.

332
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,219
before and come up with a pretty good answer.

333
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:27,460
So for today's purposes,

334
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,989
I'm going to wave my hand at the chat GPT-like

335
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:32,940
explanation of what to do that was appeared it right,

336
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,580
but what's juiciest to look at here is on the left,

337
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,859
if I now scroll down,

338
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,460
is highlighted in green is all of the

339
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,380
suggested code for implementing this here check function.

340
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,099
Now it might not be the way you implemented it yourself,

341
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,140
but I do dare say this has hints of exactly what You

342
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,250
probably did when it came to implementing a hash hash table.

343
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:54,739
And in fact,

344
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,570
I can go ahead and keep all of this code if I like how it looks.

345
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,369
Let's assume that's all correct there.

346
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,030
It might be the case that I want to now implement the load function.

347
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,250
So how about now implement load

348
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,210
function,

349
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:06,969
enter,

350
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,260
as simple as that,

351
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,580
and what data is being used?

352
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:09,719
Well,

353
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:10,700
a few different things.

354
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,739
It says one reference,

355
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,570
so it's indeed using this one file,

356
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,820
but there's also what are called comments in the

357
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,489
code with which All students are now familiar,

358
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,530
these slash slash commands in gray that are giving English

359
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,599
hints as to what this function is supposed to do.

360
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,570
There's implicit information as to what the inputs to these functions,

361
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,690
otherwise known as arguments,

362
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:27,400
are meant to be,

363
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,000
what the outputs are meant to be.

364
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,419
So the underlying AI

365
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:33,659
called copilot here kind of has a decent number of hits,

366
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:34,239
hints,

367
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,169
and much like a good TA or a good software engineer,

368
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,880
that's enough context to figure out

369
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,450
how to fill in those blanks.

370
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,250
And so here too,

371
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,719
if I scroll down now,

372
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,969
we'll see in green.

373
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,119
Some suggested code

374
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:47,299
via which

375
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:51,000
it could solve that same problem as well,

376
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,400
the load function,

377
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,969
and I dare say I've been talking for far fewer minutes

378
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:58,719
than CS 50 students spent actually coding the solution from scratch

379
00:14:58,969 --> 00:14:59,929
to this here problem.

380
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,270
So I'll go ahead and click keep.

381
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,650
I'll assume that it's correct,

382
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,919
but that's actually quite a big assumption.

383
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:07,609
And those of you wondering like why have we been learning off all this

384
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,159
if I could just ask in English it to do my homework for me,

385
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,340
I mean there's a lot to be said for the

386
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,609
muscle memory that hopefully you feel you've been developing.

387
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:14,793
For the past several weeks,

388
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:17,362
the reality is if you don't have an eye for what you're looking at,

389
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:20,353
there's no way you're going to be able to troubleshoot an issue in here,

390
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:21,552
explain it to someone else,

391
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,273
make marginal changes or the like,

392
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:26,322
and yet what's incredibly exciting even to someone like me,

393
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:27,203
all of the staff,

394
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:30,723
friends of mine in the industry is that this kind of functionality

395
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:35,302
in AI amplifies your capabilities as a programmer sort of overnight.

396
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,992
Once you have that vocabulary,

397
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:39,043
that muscle memory for doing it yourself,

398
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:42,442
the AI can just take it from there and get rid of all of the tedium,

399
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:43,083
allow you to.

400
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:46,705
Focus at the whiteboard with the other humans on sort of the overarching problems

401
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,216
that you want to solve and leave it to this AI to actually solve

402
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:51,745
problems for you.

403
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,676
A fun exercise too might be to go back at term's

404
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:57,315
end and try solving any number of the courses assignments.

405
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:57,716
For instance,

406
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:58,786
let me go ahead and do this.

407
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,306
In my terminal window here.

408
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,106
I'm going to go back to my main directory.

409
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:05,265
I'm going to create an empty file called Mario.c

410
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:06,526
that has nothing in it,

411
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:09,145
and I'm going to go ahead in my chat window here and say

412
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:12,476
please implement a program in C.

413
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:16,700
That prints a left aligned pyramid.

414
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:25,059
Of bricks using hash symbols for bricks and use the CS 50 library to

415
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,070
ask the user for a non-negative height as an integer period.

416
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,669
I dare say that's essentially the English description of what was for CS

417
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:39,200
50 this year problem set one to implement a program called Mario.C.

418
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,390
This too is sort of doing its thing.

419
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,719
It's using one reference.

420
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,239
It's working,

421
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:43,760
it knows.

422
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,530
As a hint that this file is called Mario.c and it's

423
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,559
seen a lot of those in its training data over time.

424
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,849
There's an English explanation of what I should do and

425
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:54,169
those CS 50 students in the room probably recognize the sort

426
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,570
of basic structure here of using a doy loop to prompt

427
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,419
the user for a height using the CS 50 library,

428
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,359
which has been included,

429
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,650
print a left of line pyramid using some kind of loop,

430
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:02,049
and

431
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:02,880
boom,

432
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:03,690
we are done.

433
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:06,300
And these are fairly bite-sized problems as you'll see as

434
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,848
you get to term's end with your final project,

435
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,569
which is a fairly open ended.

436
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,098
to apply your newfound knowledge and savvy with

437
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,888
programming itself to a problem of interest,

438
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:19,218
it will allow you to implement far grander projects,

439
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:22,218
far greater projects than has been possible to date,

440
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:24,249
certainly in just a few weeks we have to do it

441
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:28,208
because of this amplification of your own abilities.

442
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:29,529
So with that promise,

443
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:32,889
let's talk about how in the heck any of this is actually working.

444
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:35,619
I clearly just generated a whole lot of stuff and

445
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,458
that's how we began the story with the generation.

446
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,500
Those images and those two essays by kids,

447
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:44,099
but what is generative artificial intelligence or really what is AI itself?

448
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,150
And these are some of the underlying building blocks that aren't

449
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,790
going anywhere anytime soon and indeed have led us as a progression

450
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,660
to the capabilities you just saw.

451
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:52,339
So spam,

452
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,750
we sort of take for granted now that in our Gmail inboxes,

453
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:55,750
our Outlook inboxes,

454
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:58,180
most of the spam just ends up in a folder.

455
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,349
Well,

456
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,780
there's not some human at Microsoft or Google sort of manually labeling

457
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,319
the messages as they come in deciding spam or not spam.

458
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,069
They're figuring out using code and nowadays using AI

459
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,660
that looks like spam and therefore I'm going to put it in the spam folder,

460
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,349
which is probably correct 99% of the time,

461
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,810
but indeed there's potentially a failure rate.

462
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,530
Other applications might include handwriting recognition.

463
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:22,260
Certainly Microsoft and Google doesn't know the handwriting style

464
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,650
of all of us here in this room,

465
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,540
but it's been trained on enough other humans'

466
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,380
handwriting styles that odds are your handwriting and mine

467
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,420
looks similar to someone else's.

468
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,920
And so with very high probability they could recognize something

469
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,209
like Hello world here as indeed that same digital text.

470
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,439
All of us are into streaming services nowadays,

471
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,430
Netflix and the like.

472
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:41,750
Well,

473
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,000
they're getting pretty darn good at knowing if I watched X,

474
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,630
I might also like Y.

475
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,310
Why?

476
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:47,560
Well,

477
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,560
because of other things I've I've watched before and maybe upvoted and downvoted,

478
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,000
maybe because of other things people have watched who

479
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,469
like similar movies or TV shows to me,

480
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,280
so that too.

481
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,000
AI.

482
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,180
There's no if,

483
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,579
if,

484
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:04,530
if construct for every movie or TV show in their database.

485
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,949
It's sort of figuring out much more organically,

486
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,449
dynamically what you and I might like.

487
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,280
And then all these voice assistants today Siri,

488
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:11,660
Alexa,

489
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,420
Google Assistant,

490
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:13,020
and the like,

491
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,569
those two don't recognize your voice or necessarily

492
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,609
know what questions you're going to ask it.

493
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,660
There's no massive if else if that has all possible questions in

494
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,890
the world just waiting for you or me to ask it.

495
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:23,459
That too,

496
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:23,770
of course,

497
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,060
is dynamically generated.

498
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,329
But that's getting a bit ahead of ourselves.

499
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,089
Let's like rewind in time and some of the

500
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:31,890
parents in the audience might remember this year's game,

501
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,479
among the first arcade games in the world,

502
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:34,410
namely Pong.

503
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:37,579
And so this was a black and white game whereby there's two players,

504
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,530
a paddle on the left,

505
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:39,599
a paddle on the right,

506
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,609
and then using some kind of joystick or trackball,

507
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,400
they can move their paddles up and down,

508
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,849
and the goal is to bounce the ball back and forth and ideally catch it every time,

509
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,250
otherwise you lose a point.

510
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:49,436
This is just an

511
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,186
animated GIF,

512
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,745
so there's nothing really dramatic to watch.

513
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,826
It's going to stay at 15 against 12,

514
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,225
just looping again and again.

515
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:57,345
Nothing interesting is going to happen,

516
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:58,725
but this is a nice example

517
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,895
of a game that lends itself to solving it with code.

518
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,546
And indeed it's been in our vernacular for

519
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,776
years to play against not just the computer,

520
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,276
but the CPU,

521
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,656
the central processing unit,

522
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,135
or really the AI.

523
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:12,985
And yet AI does not need to be nearly.

524
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:14,911
Sophisticated as the tools we now see.

525
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:15,442
For instance,

526
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,751
here's a successor to Pong known as Breakout,

527
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:18,592
similar in spirit,

528
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,472
but there's just one paddle and one ball,

529
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:24,031
and the goal is to bounce the ball off of these colorful bricks and you

530
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:26,751
get more and more points depending on how high up you can get the ball.

531
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:27,842
All of us as humans,

532
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,791
even if you've never played this old school game,

533
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,921
probably have an instinct as to where we should move the

534
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,712
paddle if the ball just left it going this way,

535
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,592
which direction should I move the paddle.

536
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,369
I mean probably to the left and indeed that'll catch it on the way down.

537
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,290
So you and I just made a decision that's fairly instinctive,

538
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,579
but it's been ingrained in us,

539
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,619
but we could sort of take all the fun out of the

540
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,770
game and start to quantify it or describe it a little more algorithmically

541
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,819
step by step.

542
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,599
In fact,

543
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,959
decision trees are a concept from economics,

544
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,760
strategic thinking,

545
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,839
computer science as well.

546
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,760
That's one way of solving this problem in such a way that you

547
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,910
will always play this game well if you just follow this algorithm.

548
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,599
So for instance,

549
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,069
how might we implement code

550
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,160
or decision making process for something like breakout?

551
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:11,280
Well,

552
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,640
you ask yourself first is the ball to the left of the paddle?

553
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:14,650
If so,

554
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:15,770
you know where we're going,

555
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,920
then go ahead and move the paddle left.

556
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,119
But what if the answer were no in fact?

557
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:20,449
Well,

558
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,569
you don't just blindly move the paddle to the right,

559
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,010
probably,

560
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,280
what should you then ask?

561
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:27,540
Are you right below the ball.

562
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,619
If the ball's coming right at you,

563
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,150
you don't want to just naively go to the right and then risk missing it.

564
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,369
So there's another question to ask.

565
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,949
Is the ball to the right of the paddle?

566
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,130
And that's a yes no question.

567
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,010
If yes,

568
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,579
well then,

569
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:36,819
OK,

570
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:37,890
move it to the right.

571
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:38,630
But if not,

572
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:42,810
you should probably stay exactly where you are and don't move the paddle.

573
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,219
All right,

574
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,819
so that's fairly deterministic,

575
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:45,640
if you will,

576
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,170
um,

577
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,810
and we can map it to code using pseudo code in,

578
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:49,250
uh,

579
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,739
say a class like CS 50.

580
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,699
We can say in a loop,

581
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:51,939
well,

582
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,290
while the game is ongoing,

583
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,010
if the balls to the left of the paddle.

584
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,540
Then move the paddle left.

585
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,689
ET if the balls to the right of the paddle,

586
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,660
sorry for the typo there,

587
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:01,160
move the paddle right.

588
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,170
Es just don't move the paddle.

589
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,160
And so these decision trees as we drew it,

590
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,500
have a perfect mapping to code or really pseudo code in this particular case,

591
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,569
which is to say that's how people who implemented the breakout game or

592
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:16,290
the pong game who implemented a computer player surely coded it up.

593
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,839
It was as straightforward as that.

594
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,359
But how about something like tic tac toe,

595
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,079
which some of you might have played on the way

596
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,199
in for just a moment on the scraps of paper,

597
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:23,609
um.

598
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,060
That you might have had,

599
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,329
uh,

600
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:29,209
here we have a tic tac toe board with two O's and two X's.

601
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:29,969
For those unfamiliar,

602
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,209
this game tic tac toe,

603
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,280
otherwise known as knights and Crosses,

604
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:36,319
is a matter of going back and forth Xs and O's between two people,

605
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,449
and the goal is to get 3 O's in a row or 3 X's in a row,

606
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,170
either vertically,

607
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,010
horizontally,

608
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:41,810
or diagonally.

609
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:42,579
So this is a game.

610
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,020
in mid progress.

611
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:44,229
Well,

612
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,060
let's consider how you could solve the game of tic tac toe like a computer,

613
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,150
like an AI might.

614
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:49,430
Well,

615
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,140
you could ask yourself,

616
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,939
can I get 3 in a row on this turn?

617
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:52,310
Well,

618
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,989
if yes,

619
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,829
we'll play in the square to get 3 in a row.

620
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,180
It's as straightforward as that.

621
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,310
If you can't though,

622
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,180
what should you ask?

623
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,430
Well,

624
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,189
can my opponent get 3 in a row on their next turn?

625
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:02,170
Because if so,

626
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,079
you should probably at least block

627
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,920
their move next so at least you don't lose now.

628
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,920
But this game tic tac toe is relatively simple as it is,

629
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,839
gets a little harder to play

630
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,160
when it's not obvious where you should go.

631
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,209
Now all of us as humans,

632
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,250
if you grew up playing this game,

633
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,829
probably had heuristics you use,

634
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,130
like you really like the middle or you like the top corner or something like that,

635
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,109
so we probably

636
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,449
can uh make our next move quickly.

637
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,050
But is it optimal?

638
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:28,540
And I dare say if back in childhood or more

639
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,849
recently you've ever lost a game of tic tac toe,

640
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,859
like you're just bad at tic tac toe because logically there's no reason you

641
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:38,300
should ever lose a game of tic tac toe if you're playing optimally.

642
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,479
At worst you should force a tie,

643
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,369
but at best you should win the game.

644
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,810
So think of that the next time you play tic tac toe and lose,

645
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,089
like you're doing something wrong,

646
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:46,609
but

647
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:48,180
in your defense it's because.

648
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:49,863
Question mark is sort of not obvious.

649
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,942
Like how do I answer it when the answer is not right in

650
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:56,032
front of me to move for the win or move for the block?

651
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:56,243
Well,

652
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:59,682
one algorithm you could have been using all of these years is called Mini Max,

653
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:00,703
and as the name suggests,

654
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:03,973
it's all about minimizing something and or maximizing something else.

655
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:04,623
So here too,

656
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:07,432
let's take a bit of fun out of the game and turn it into some math,

657
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,902
but relatively simple math.

658
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,383
So here we have 3 representative.

659
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,615
To boards O has won here.

660
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:14,666
X has one here,

661
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:15,725
and the middle is a tie.

662
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:17,796
It doesn't matter how we score these boards,

663
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,385
but we need a consistent system.

664
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:21,666
So I'm going to propose that anytime O wins,

665
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,495
the score of the game is -1.

666
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:24,666
Anytime X wins,

667
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:26,735
the score of the game is a positive one,

668
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:28,385
and anytime nobody wins,

669
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:29,975
the score is 0.

670
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,316
So at this point,

671
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:33,786
each of these boards have these values -1,

672
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:34,395
0,

673
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:35,026
and 1.

674
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,410
So the goal therefore,

675
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,699
in this game of tic tac toe now is for X to maximize its score because

676
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,719
one is the biggest value available and O's goal in life is to minimize its score.

677
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:46,140
So that's how we take the fun out of the game.

678
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,130
We turn it into math where one

679
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,500
player just wants to maximize,

680
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,369
one player just wants to minimize their score.

681
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:52,780
All right,

682
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:53,660
so a quick,

683
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,020
uh,

684
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,050
sanity check here.

685
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:55,739
Here's a board.

686
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,890
It's not color coded.

687
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,810
What is the value of this board?

688
00:24:59,680 --> 00:24:59,969
One,

689
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,349
because X

690
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,760
has in fact 1

691
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,479
straight there down the middle.

692
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,099
So X is 1000 is -1,

693
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,949
otherwise a tie.

694
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,209
So now let's see how we go about with those principles in place,

695
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
figuring out where we should play in tic tac toe.

696
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,630
Now here's a fairly easy configuration.

697
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,560
There's only 2 moves left.

698
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,869
It's not hard to figure out how to win or tie this game,

699
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,959
but let's use it for

700
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,339
for simplicity.

701
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,046
O's turn for instance.

702
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:26,495
So where cano go?

703
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:26,816
Well,

704
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:27,806
that invites the question,

705
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:27,855
Well,

706
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:29,936
what is the value of the board or how do we how

707
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:32,926
do we minimize the value of the board for O to win?

708
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:33,316
Well,

709
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:37,086
O can go in one of two places top left or bottom middle.

710
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:38,725
Which way should O go?

711
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:39,015
Well,

712
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:40,696
if O goes in top left,

713
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:42,906
we should consider what's the value of this board.

714
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:43,926
Is it minimal?

715
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:44,375
Well,

716
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:45,166
let's see.

717
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:46,806
If O goes here,

718
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:47,735
X is obviously.

719
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,102
Go here X is therefore going to win,

720
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:52,021
so the value of this board is going to be a

721
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:53,021
1.

722
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,991
Now since there's only one way logically to get from this configuration to this one,

723
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:59,942
we might as well call the value of this board by transitivity 1.

724
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:02,432
And so O probably doesn't want to go there because

725
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:04,852
that's a pretty maximal score and O wants to minimize.

726
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:05,631
Over here though,

727
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:06,982
if O goes bottom middle,

728
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:10,271
well then X is going to go top left and now no one has one,

729
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:11,952
so the value of this board is thus.

730
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,089
0,

731
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,589
we might as well treat this as 0 because that's the only way to get there logically.

732
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:17,479
So now

733
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:21,040
O more mathematically and logically can decide do I want

734
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,579
an endpoint of 1 or an endpoint of 0?

735
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,160
Well,

736
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,339
0 is probably the better option because that's less than 1,

737
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:30,050
and thus it's the minimal possibility.

738
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,800
So O

739
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,699
is going to go ahead in the bottom middle and at least force a tie.

740
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,569
And so that's where you.

741
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:38,609
The evidence where if you humans are ever losing the game of tic tac toe,

742
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:40,880
you have not followed that their logic,

743
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,369
but you could probably do it if there's just 2 moves left.

744
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:44,400
But the catch is,

745
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:47,199
let's go ahead and sort of rewind to 3 moves left.

746
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,670
Here there are 3 blanks,

747
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,880
and I've kind of zoomed out.

748
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,569
The catch is that the decision tree gets a lot

749
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,959
bigger the more and more moves that are left.

750
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,890
It gets sort of bigger and bushier in that it's essentially doubling in size.

751
00:26:58,979 --> 00:26:59,630
And with,

752
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,520
and that's great if you have the luxury of writing it down on a piece of paper,

753
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:05,260
but if you're doing this on your head while playing against 1/5 grader,

754
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,689
if I may,

755
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,170
you're probably not drawing out all of the various

756
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,920
boards and configurations trying to play it optimally.

757
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,290
You're going with some instinct,

758
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,800
and your instincts might not be aligned with an algorithm

759
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:19,119
that is tried and truedmini Max that will ideally get you to win the game,

760
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,130
but at least will get you to force a tie if you can't win.

761
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,619
But

762
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,300
Tic Tac Toe is not that hard.

763
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:25,540
I mean,

764
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,729
how many different ways are there to play Tic Tac Toe?

765
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:31,859
We could write a computer program to pretty much play Tic Tac Toe optimally.

766
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:32,439
Um,

767
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,650
we could use code like this if the player is X for each possible move,

768
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,089
calculate the score for the board at that point in time,

769
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,250
and then choose the move with the highest score.

770
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,369
So you just try all possibilities mathematically and then you make the decision.

771
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,010
Most of us in our heads are not doing that,

772
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,729
but we could,

773
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,099
else if the player iso,

774
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,329
essentially do the same thing but choose the minimal

775
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:50,380
possible score.

776
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,339
So that's the code for implementing tic tac toe.

777
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,989
How many ways are there to play tic tac toe though?

778
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,530
Well,

779
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:58,489
255,168,

780
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:00,099
which means if we were to draw that tree,

781
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,495
it would be pretty darn big and it Take you quite a

782
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:04,446
bit of time to sort of think through all those possibilities.

783
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:05,235
So in your defense,

784
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:07,005
you're maybe not that bad at tic tac toe,

785
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:09,436
it's just harder than you thought as a game.

786
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,556
But what about games with which we might as adults be more familiar?

787
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:12,816
Well,

788
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:13,885
what about the game of chess,

789
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,806
which is often used as a measure of like how smart a computer is,

790
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:19,796
whether it's Watson back in the day playing against it or something else?

791
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:20,086
Well,

792
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,105
if we consider even just the 1st 4 moves of tic tac toe,

793
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,135
whereby I mean black goes and white goes,

794
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:26,645
and then they each go 3 more times,

795
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,326
so 4 pair wise moves,

796
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:31,485
how many different ways are there to play chess?

797
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:31,671
Well,

798
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:32,702
it turns out

799
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,832
85 billion just to get the game started,

800
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:39,482
and that's a lot of decisions to consider and then make.

801
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:41,112
How about the game of Goa familiar?

802
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:45,021
Consider the first four more 266 quintillion possibilities.

803
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:49,472
And this is where we sort of as humans and even with our modern PCs and

804
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:53,342
Macs and phones kind of have to throw up our hands because I don't have this many

805
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:55,552
bits of memory in my computer.

806
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:58,291
I don't have this many hours in my life left to actually

807
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,202
crunch all of those numbers and figure out the solution and so.

808
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:05,297
So where AI comes in is where it's no longer as simple as just writing if,

809
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:05,817
else's,

810
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,647
and loops and no longer as simple as just trying all possibilities,

811
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:12,057
you instead need to write code that doesn't solve

812
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:14,537
the problem directly but in some sense indirectly.

813
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,488
You write code

814
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:18,647
so that the computer figures out how to win,

815
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:22,177
perhaps by showing it configurations of the board that are a

816
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,417
good place to be in that is promising and maybe showing

817
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,657
it boards that it doesn't want to find itself in the

818
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,927
configuration of because that's going to lead it to lose.

819
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:30,378
In other words,

820
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:30,858
you train.

821
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:31,333
It

822
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:33,404
but not necessarily as exhaustive,

823
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:35,793
and this is what we mean nowadays by machine learning,

824
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:39,563
writing code via which machines learn how to solve

825
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:42,723
problems generally by being trained on massive amounts of

826
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:45,803
data and then in new problems looking for patterns

827
00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:48,553
via which they can apply those past training data

828
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:49,913
to the problem at hand.

829
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:52,114
And reinforcement learning is one way to think about this.

830
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:52,473
In fact,

831
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:52,913
in fact,

832
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:54,443
we as humans use

833
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,083
reinforcement learning,

834
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:57,913
which is a type of machine learning sort of

835
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:00,394
all of the time in fact.

836
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,010
A fun demonstration to watch here involves these pancakes.

837
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:04,329
So in fact,

838
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,579
let me go ahead and pull up a short recording here of an actual researcher in a lab

839
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,640
who's trying to teach a robot how to make,

840
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,199
how to flip pancakes.

841
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:14,680
So we'll see here in this video

842
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,839
that there's a robot that has an arm that can go up,

843
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:17,000
down,

844
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,170
left,

845
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:17,489
right.

846
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,760
This of course is the human,

847
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,609
the researcher,

848
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:23,290
and he's just going to show the robot one or more times like how to flip a pancake.

849
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,989
And crosses his fingers and OK,

850
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:27,939
seems to have done it well,

851
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:28,540
does it again,

852
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:29,859
not quite the same,

853
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,270
but pretty good.

854
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,729
And now he's going to let the robot just try to figure out how

855
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:39,040
to flip that pancake after having just trained it a few different times.

856
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:40,130
The first few times,

857
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,979
odds are the robot's not going to do super well because it really

858
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:47,170
doesn't understand what the human just did or what the whole purpose of.

859
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:47,579
But,

860
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:51,400
and here's the key detail with reinforcement learning behind the scenes,

861
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,640
the human

862
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:55,680
is probably rewarding the robot when it does a good job,

863
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,130
like better and better it flips the more.

864
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:59,574
It's rewarded as by hitting a key and giving it a point,

865
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,025
for instance,

866
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:02,944
or giving it the digital equivalent of a cookie or conversely,

867
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,714
every time the robot screws up and drops the pancake on the floor,

868
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:07,464
sort of a proverbial slap on the wrist,

869
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:11,295
a punishment so that it does less of that behavior the next time.

870
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:12,785
And any of you who are parents,

871
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,655
which by definition today many of you are,

872
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:15,415
odds are,

873
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:19,145
whether it's not this or maybe just verbal approval or reprimands,

874
00:31:19,305 --> 00:31:22,625
have you probably trained children at some point to do more of one thing.

875
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,130
And less of another.

876
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:25,660
And what you're seeing in the backdrop there is

877
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,020
now just a quantization of the movements X,

878
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:28,219
Y,

879
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:33,010
and Z coordinates so that it can do more of the X's and the Y's and the Z that led it to

880
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,290
some kind of reward.

881
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,010
And now after you're up to some 50 trials,

882
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,849
the robot seems to be getting better and better

883
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,569
such that like a good human,

884
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:43,219
we'll see if I can do this without embarrassing myself,

885
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,219
can flip the thing.

886
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:45,739
That's pretty good.

887
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:46,130
That's pretty,

888
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:47,250
I've been doing this a long time.

889
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,750
OK.

890
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:49,400
So

891
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:54,650
we've seen then how you might reinforce

892
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,339
learning through that kind of domain.

893
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,170
Let's take an example that's familiar to those of you who are gamers.

894
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,020
Any time you've played a game where there's some kind of

895
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,989
map or a world that you need to explore up,

896
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,170
down,

897
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,339
left,

898
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:03,619
right,

899
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,180
maybe you're trying to get to the exit.

900
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:05,459
So

901
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:08,719
here simplistically is the player at the yellow dot.

902
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,140
Here,

903
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,530
for instance,

904
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,420
in green is the exit of the map,

905
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,699
and you want to get to that point and maybe somewhere

906
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,060
else in this world there's a lot of like lava pits.

907
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,234
You don't want to fall into the lava pit because you lose a life

908
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:21,954
or you lose a point or there's some penalty or punishment associated with that.

909
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:22,285
Well,

910
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:22,724
we,

911
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,704
with this bird's eye view can obviously see how to get to the green dot,

912
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:28,005
but if you're playing a game like Zelda or something like that,

913
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:29,234
all you can do is move up,

914
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:29,405
down,

915
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:29,604
left,

916
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:29,905
right,

917
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,354
and sort of hope for the best.

918
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:32,444
So let's do just that.

919
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,194
Suppose the yellow dot just randomly chooses a direction

920
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:36,314
and goes to the right.

921
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:36,604
Well,

922
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,604
now we can sort of take away a life,

923
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:39,555
take away a point,

924
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,915
or effectively punish it

925
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:42,844
so that it knows don't do that.

926
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:45,829
And so long as the player has a bit of memory,

927
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,459
either the human player or the code that's implementing this,

928
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,550
just with a dark red line,

929
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:53,109
that means don't do that again because that didn't lead to a good outcome.

930
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,229
So maybe the next time the yellow dot goes this way and this way,

931
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:55,510
and then,

932
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:55,630
ah,

933
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:57,989
I didn't realize that that's actually the same lava pit,

934
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,699
but that's fine.

935
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,739
Use a little bit more memory and remind me,

936
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:03,619
don't do that because I just lost a second life in this story.

937
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,050
And maybe it goes this way next time,

938
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,339
ah,

939
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:06,859
now I need to remember,

940
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:07,780
don't do that.

941
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,670
But effectively I'm either being punished for.

942
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:10,614
Doing the wrong thing,

943
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,055
uh,

944
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,574
or as we'll soon see,

945
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:15,175
being rewarded for doing more of the successful

946
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:18,295
thing and just by chance maybe I finally make

947
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,494
my way to the exit in this way and so I can be rewarded for that.

948
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,135
Now I got 100 points or whatever it is,

949
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:23,964
the high score.

950
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,614
So now as for these green lines,

951
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:28,494
I can just follow that path again and again and I

952
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:30,535
can always win this game kind of like me nowadays,

953
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,255
like 30 years later playing Super Mario Brothers

954
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:33,535
because they can get through all the warp levels

955
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:34,935
because I know where everything is because for

956
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,305
some reason that's still stored in my brain.

957
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,680
Is this the best way to play?

958
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,560
Am I as good at Super Mario Brothers as I might think?

959
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,619
What's bad about this solution?

960
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,229
Yeah.

961
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,680
Exactly,

962
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:50,920
yeah,

963
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,439
I've moved many more times than I need to and just for fun today,

964
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,160
what grade are you in?

965
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:56,199
7th grade.

966
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:56,770
Wonderful.

967
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,579
So now 7th grade observation is like exactly that,

968
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:00,199
that we

969
00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:01,859
could have taken a shorter path,

970
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,520
which is essentially that way,

971
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,199
albeit

972
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,810
uh making some straight moves.

973
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:08,449
And so we're never gonna find that shorter path.

974
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,629
We're never gonna get the highest score possible if

975
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:13,560
I just keep naively following my well trodden path.

976
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,520
And so how do we break out of that mold?

977
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,570
And you can see this even in the real world,

978
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,129
another sort of.

979
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,389
No example is I'm the type of person for some reason

980
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,000
where if I go to a restaurant for the first time,

981
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:24,000
I choose a dish off the menu and I really like it,

982
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,708
I will never again order anything else off that menu

983
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,580
other than that dish because I know it is good,

984
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,708
but there could be something even better on the menu,

985
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,260
but I'm never going to explore that because I'm sort of fixed in my ways,

986
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,458
as some of you from the smiles might be too.

987
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:40,989
But what if we took advantage of exploring just a little bit?

988
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,010
And there's this principle of exploring versus exploiting when

989
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,228
it comes to using artificial intelligence to solve problems.

990
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,958
Up until now I've just been exploiting knowledge I already have.

991
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,250
Don't go through the red walls,

992
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,449
do go through the green walls.

993
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:52,850
Exploit,

994
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:53,250
exploit,

995
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:53,728
exploit,

996
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,719
and I will get to

997
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,958
a final solution.

998
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,399
But what if I just sprinkle in a little bit of randomness along the

999
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:03,679
way and maybe 10% of the time as represented by this epsilon variable.

1000
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:04,310
I,

1001
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,570
as the computer in the story,

1002
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,780
generate a random number between 0 and 1,

1003
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,760
and if it's less than that,

1004
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,060
which is going to happen 10% of the time,

1005
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,110
I'm going to make a random move instead of one

1006
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,100
that I know will get me closer to the exit.

1007
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,899
Otherwise I'll indeed make the move with the highest value.

1008
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,750
Now this isn't going to necessarily win me the game that first time,

1009
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,629
but if I play it enough and enough and enough and insert some of this randomness,

1010
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,709
I might very well find a better solution.

1011
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:28,500
And therefore be a better player,

1012
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,409
a better winner

1013
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:30,139
overall.

1014
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,780
If I just 10% of the time ordered something else off the menu,

1015
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:35,090
I might find that there's an amazing dish out there

1016
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,290
that otherwise I wouldn't have discovered.

1017
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:39,929
And so indeed using that approach,

1018
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,820
can we finally find a more optimal path through the maze,

1019
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,209
as was shorter there,

1020
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,699
presumably therefore maximizing our score and doing even

1021
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:49,219
better than we might have by just.

1022
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,300
Exploiting the same knowledge,

1023
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,590
so you can see this even in the game of Breakout,

1024
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,479
especially if you write a solution in code to play this game for you.

1025
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,659
Let me go ahead and pull up another video recording of an AI playing Breakout,

1026
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,459
and what this AI is doing is essentially figuring out,

1027
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,540
maybe more intelligently than you or I could,

1028
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,100
how to play this game

1029
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:09,219
optimally.

1030
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,780
And what we'll see here

1031
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,550
is that.

1032
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:15,219
Just like the pancake flipping robot,

1033
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:18,000
there's some notion of scoring and rewards and penalties here.

1034
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,479
So like right now the paddle's just doing random stuff.

1035
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
It doesn't really know how to play the game yet,

1036
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,530
but it realizes after 200 episodes that oh my score goes up if

1037
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,320
I hit the ball and it goes down equivalently if I miss it,

1038
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:32,449
and it's still a little twitchy,

1039
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,570
it doesn't quite understand what it's supposed.

1040
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,500
To do and why,

1041
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,459
but if you do it again and again and again and it's rewarded and or punished enough,

1042
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:42,179
you'll see that it starts to get

1043
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,699
pretty good and closer to what a good human might do.

1044
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:48,540
But here's where the algorithm gets a little creepy.

1045
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:50,590
If you let it play long enough or if you and I,

1046
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:50,989
the humans,

1047
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,739
play long enough,

1048
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,000
you might find a certain trick to the game.

1049
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,350
I dare say the AI becomes a bit scarily sentient.

1050
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,649
In that turns out if you're smart enough to break through that top row,

1051
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,709
you can let the game just play itself for you

1052
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,250
and maximize your score without even touching the ball,

1053
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,379
something that I do find a little creepy that I

1054
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:10,489
just figured out how to do that without being told,

1055
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:14,570
but it's just a logical continuation of rewarding it for good behavior

1056
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,729
and punishing it

1057
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,489
for

1058
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,770
bad behavior.

1059
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,219
So that next time you have an occasion to play Breakout,

1060
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:23,570
consider that kind of strategy as opposed to doing more of the work yourself,

1061
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,239
let the computer do it for you instead.

1062
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:26,721
Well,

1063
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:31,011
what else is there to consider in this world of AI in the context of machine learning?

1064
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:31,372
Well,

1065
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:34,971
there's specifically a category of learning that's supervised,

1066
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:36,191
and we've been using this for years.

1067
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:36,572
And in fact,

1068
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:39,731
our first example of spam early on was certainly supervised.

1069
00:37:39,812 --> 00:37:39,931
Why?

1070
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:42,132
Because it was you and I who was like putting

1071
00:37:42,132 --> 00:37:44,521
the email into the spam folder and to this day,

1072
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:47,521
maybe once a day I hit the keyboard shortcut in Gmail to say,

1073
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:47,672
Ah,

1074
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:48,412
this is spam.

1075
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:49,362
You should have caught this,

1076
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,761
and that is training Google's algorithm further,

1077
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,251
assuming it's not just little old me,

1078
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,491
but maybe thousands of people tagging that same kind of.

1079
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:55,993
Email

1080
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:56,864
as spam,

1081
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,964
that's supervised learning and that there's a human in the loop doing

1082
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:03,114
at least something so spam detection might be one of those.

1083
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,323
But the catch is that labeling data in

1084
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:07,684
that way manually just doesn't scale very well.

1085
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:11,364
That would be akin to having someone at Google or Microsoft labeling every email

1086
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:14,154
or someone at Netflix doing the same for all of the videos out there.

1087
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:16,194
It's expensive in terms of human power,

1088
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:18,483
and there's certainly problems out there with so much data.

1089
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:22,033
It's just not realistic for humans to label millions of pieces of data,

1090
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:23,263
billions of pieces of data.

1091
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:24,444
We've got to move to an

1092
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:25,906
Supervised model.

1093
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:29,345
And so this is where the world starts to consider deep learning,

1094
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,656
solving problems

1095
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:35,506
using code whereby you don't even have humans in the loop in quite the same way.

1096
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:38,635
And neural networks inspired by the world of biology are sort

1097
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:41,395
of the inspiration for what is the state of the art,

1098
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:44,395
even underlying today's rubber duck and more generally these

1099
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:46,906
things called large language models like chat GPT,

1100
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:47,506
and the like.

1101
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:50,105
So here pictured somewhat abstractly is a neuron,

1102
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:52,426
and it's something in the human body that transmits a signal,

1103
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:52,756
say,

1104
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:53,436
from left to right.

1105
00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:55,468
Electrically and if you have multiple neurons,

1106
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:58,177
you can intercommunicate among them so that if I think a thought,

1107
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:00,667
then I know how to raise my hand because some kind of

1108
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,937
message electrically has gone from my head to this extremity here.

1109
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:06,978
So that's in essence what I remember from 9th grade biology.

1110
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:08,357
But as the computer scientists,

1111
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:10,097
we sort of abstract all of this away.

1112
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:13,107
So instead of calling these two neurons drawing them as neurons,

1113
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,458
let's just start drawing neurons as these little circles,

1114
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:18,147
and if they have connective tissue between them of sorts,

1115
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:19,748
we'll just draw a straight line,

1116
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:20,917
an edge between them.

1117
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,468
So this is what a computer scientist would call.

1118
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,239
A graph.

1119
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,250
If you have two such neurons over here leading to 11 neuron here,

1120
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:31,290
you can think of this as being like maybe 2 inputs to a problem

1121
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,360
and now one output there too.

1122
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,449
We can represent the notion of problem solving,

1123
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,770
which is what CS 50 and intercourses more generally are all about.

1124
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:40,929
So let's solve a problem with a neural

1125
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,179
network without necessarily training it in advance,

1126
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,489
just letting it figure out how to answer this question.

1127
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,300
Here's a very simple two dimensional world,

1128
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,100
XY grid,

1129
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,179
and here are two dots,

1130
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:51,459
and the dots in this world are either blue or they are.

1131
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:51,771
Red,

1132
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:53,481
but I have no idea yet

1133
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:55,922
what makes a dot blue or red.

1134
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:56,402
However,

1135
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:58,251
if you train me on those two dots,

1136
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:00,471
I bet I could come up with predictions,

1137
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,332
especially if you let me label this world

1138
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:04,372
in terms of X coordinates on the horizontal,

1139
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:05,771
Y coordinates on the vertical,

1140
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:07,372
and then you know what we can think of this

1141
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,602
neural network very simply as representing the X coordinate here,

1142
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:11,771
the Y coordinate here,

1143
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:16,612
and the answer I want to get is quote unquote red or blue or 0 or 1 or true or false,

1144
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:17,562
however you want to think

1145
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:18,882
of the representation.

1146
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:20,451
So how do I get from a specific.

1147
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,833
XY coordinate to a prediction of color if I only know the coordinates.

1148
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:24,964
Well,

1149
00:40:25,364 --> 00:40:26,043
up from the get-go,

1150
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,474
maybe the best I can do is just divide the world into

1151
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:30,404
blue dots on the left and red dots on the right,

1152
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:31,283
a best fit line,

1153
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:31,874
if you will,

1154
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,513
based on very minimal data.

1155
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:34,033
Of course,

1156
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:35,354
if you give me a third dot,

1157
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:39,224
it's going to be pretty easy to dize that I was a little too hasty.

1158
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,364
That line is not vertical,

1159
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:43,204
so maybe we pivot the line this way and now I'm back in business.

1160
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:47,874
Now I can predict with higher probability based on XY what color the next dot will be.

1161
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,444
You give me enough of these dots.

1162
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,229
I can come up with a pretty good best fit line.

1163
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,139
It's not perfect,

1164
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,429
but here's a hint at why AI is not perfect.

1165
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,780
But 99% of the time maybe I'll be able to predict correctly,

1166
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:00,760
and I can do even better if you let me squiggle the

1167
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,179
line a little bit and maybe make it more than just a simple

1168
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:04,350
slope.

1169
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,500
So what is it we're really doing

1170
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,149
with implementing this neural network,

1171
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:11,310
albeit simplistically with just 3 neurons?

1172
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:11,510
Well,

1173
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:14,030
essentially we're trying to come up with 3 values,

1174
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,550
3 parameters an A,

1175
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:16,070
a B,

1176
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:16,709
and a C.

1177
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,389
And what do those represent?

1178
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:18,639
Well,

1179
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,989
really just a solution to this formula that there line we drew

1180
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,520
can be represented if you think back to like high school math

1181
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,419
with a formula along these lines whereby it's ax x plus B

1182
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,030
times Y plus some constant C and we can just arbitrarily conclude that

1183
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,000
if that value mathematically gives me a number greater than 0,

1184
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,429
predict it's going to be blue.

1185
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,280
Otherwise predict it's going to be red.

1186
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,850
We can sort of map our mathematics just like with tic tac toe

1187
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,030
to the actual problem we care about by defining the world in this way.

1188
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,389
And so if you give me enough.

1189
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:50,176
Data points and enough data points I can come up with answers for that A,

1190
00:41:50,486 --> 00:41:50,645
B,

1191
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:51,045
C,

1192
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,085
the so-called parameters in neural networks.

1193
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:53,766
Now in reality,

1194
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:57,025
neural networks are not composed of like 3 neurons and a couple of edges.

1195
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,555
They look a little something more like this,

1196
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:02,355
and in practice they've got billions of these things here on the screen,

1197
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:06,805
in which case pretty much every one of these edges represents some mathematical

1198
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:11,275
value that was contrived based on lots and lots of training data.

1199
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:12,085
And whereas I,

1200
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,075
the computer scientist,

1201
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:15,926
might know what these neurons over here represent because those are my.

1202
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:17,562
Inputs 3 in this case,

1203
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:17,971
and I,

1204
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:18,691
the computer scientist,

1205
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,602
know what this one represents at the end.

1206
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:24,362
If you sort of took the hood off of this thing and looked inside the neural network,

1207
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:25,771
even though there'd be millions,

1208
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:27,402
billions of numbers going on there,

1209
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:31,521
I can't tell you what this neuron represents or why this edge has this weight.

1210
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:34,001
It's because of the massive amount of training data that

1211
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:36,162
that's just how the math works out.

1212
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:37,281
And if you feed me more data,

1213
00:42:37,332 --> 00:42:38,961
I might change some of those parameters more.

1214
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:41,201
So the graph ultimately might look quite different,

1215
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:45,372
but my inputs and my outputs are going to be what I use to solve that problem.

1216
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,419
So if you want to predict like rainfall from humidity or pressure,

1217
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,419
you can have two inputs giving that one output an advertising dollar spent in a given

1218
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:56,050
month that might predict sales by just having trained again on such volumes of data.

1219
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,139
And when we get now full circle to something like CS 50's rubber

1220
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:02,750
duck and large language models like Claude and Gemini and Chat GBT,

1221
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,090
what's really happening,

1222
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,449
and this is all hot off the press in recent years,

1223
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,899
screenshotted here are some of the recent research papers that

1224
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:11,409
have driven a lot of this advancement in recent years.

1225
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:12,060
You have.

1226
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,341
From OpenAI say a generative pre-trained transformer,

1227
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,420
which is a lot to say,

1228
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,281
but there's the GPT in chat GPT,

1229
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,571
and essentially this is a neural network that's

1230
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:25,781
been trained on large volumes of textual information

1231
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,591
that gives us the interactive chat feature that we have in

1232
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:32,660
the class and we all have more generally in chatBT itself.

1233
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,591
So an example of what is actually happening underneath the hood of these GPTs.

1234
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,750
Well,

1235
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:38,391
here's a paragraph.

1236
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,751
That up until recent years

1237
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:44,842
was kind of a hard paragraph to end with the Massachusetts is

1238
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:47,261
a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

1239
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,082
It borders on the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

1240
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:50,402
The state's capital is.

1241
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:53,862
Almost anyone living in Massachusetts probably knows that answer,

1242
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:57,552
but if this AI has just been trained on lots and lots of data,

1243
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:01,271
there's probably a lot of people who say Massachusetts in part of a sentence,

1244
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:01,721
and then

1245
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:02,511
the answer,

1246
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:03,201
which I won't say yet,

1247
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:04,681
is in the other part of the.

1248
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:05,163
Sentence.

1249
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:06,282
But in this example,

1250
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:09,683
given that the question we're asking is sort of so far

1251
00:44:10,173 --> 00:44:13,093
from some of the useful key words up until recently this was

1252
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:15,252
a hard problem to solve because there was so much distance.

1253
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:15,732
Moreover,

1254
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:18,373
there's these nouns that are being used to substitute for the

1255
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:20,562
proper noun like we suddenly start calling it a state,

1256
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:22,163
we call it a state down here,

1257
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:26,812
and it wasn't necessarily obvious to AIs that we're talking about the same thing as

1258
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:30,732
if it were just city comma state where you'd have much more proximity so.

1259
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:31,604
In a nutshell,

1260
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:32,654
what we now do,

1261
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:34,624
especially to solve problems like these,

1262
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:37,944
is we first break down a sentence or the training data or input

1263
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:41,533
a like into like an array or a list of the words themselves.

1264
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:44,944
We come up with a representation of each of these words.

1265
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:45,533
For instance,

1266
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,694
the word Massachusetts,

1267
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:48,333
if you encode it in a certain way,

1268
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:51,263
is going to be represented with an array or vector of numbers,

1269
00:44:51,343 --> 00:44:52,493
floating point values,

1270
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:57,384
so many so that the word Massachusetts in one model would use these 1,536.

1271
00:44:57,754 --> 00:45:00,754
Floating point numbers to represent Massachusetts

1272
00:45:00,754 --> 00:45:02,764
essentially in an N-dimensional space,

1273
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,064
so not just an XY plane,

1274
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,344
but somewhere sort of virtually out there.

1275
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:07,024
And then,

1276
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:09,064
and this has been the key to these GPTs,

1277
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:13,705
attention is calculated based on all of that data whereby in this picture

1278
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:17,274
the thicker lines imply more of a relationship between those two words.

1279
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,715
So Massachusetts and state is inferred as having a thicker line,

1280
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:23,064
a higher attention from one word to the other,

1281
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:23,764
whereas our

1282
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:26,926
and our is and our thes have thinner lines because they're just not as

1283
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:31,035
much signal to the AI as to what the answer to this question is.

1284
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:32,105
Meanwhile,

1285
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:34,926
when you then feed that sentence like the

1286
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:38,166
state's capital is one word per neuron here,

1287
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:40,775
the goal is to get the answer to that question.

1288
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:43,045
And even here this is way smaller of a

1289
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:45,395
representation than the actual neural network would be.

1290
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:46,476
But in effect,

1291
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:48,006
all these LLMs,

1292
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,275
large language models are

1293
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,045
are just statistic.

1294
00:45:50,376 --> 00:45:53,937
Models like what is the highest probability word that it should spit out at the

1295
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:58,406
end of this paragraph based on all of the Reddit posts and Google search results

1296
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:02,166
and encyclopedias and Wikipedias that it's found and trained on online?

1297
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:02,457
Well,

1298
00:46:02,497 --> 00:46:03,767
the answer hopefully will be

1299
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:04,757
Boston.

1300
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:05,606
But of course

1301
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:06,816
1% of the time,

1302
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:07,576
maybe less than that,

1303
00:46:07,616 --> 00:46:10,806
the answer might not be correct and even CS 50's own duck is fallible,

1304
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:12,257
even though we've written lots of code to

1305
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:14,767
try to put downward pressure on those mistakes,

1306
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:16,287
and those mistakes are what we'll call.

1307
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:17,270
Lastly,

1308
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,469
hallucinations where the AI just makes

1309
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:21,669
something up perhaps because some crazy human

1310
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:25,260
on the internet made something up and it was interpreted as authoritative or

1311
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,750
just by bad luck because of a bit of that exploration 10% of the time,

1312
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,780
1% of the time,

1313
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,110
the AI sort of veered this way in the large language model in the

1314
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:36,739
neural network and spit out an answer that just in fact is not correct.

1315
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:38,989
And so I thought I'd end for today on this final note.

1316
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,790
A poem with which many of us might have grown up from Shel Silverstein here about

1317
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,949
the homework machine which years ago somehow sort

1318
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:46,699
of predicted the state we would be in

1319
00:46:46,989 --> 00:46:48,739
with these AI machines.

1320
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:49,500
He said,

1321
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,500
the homework machine,

1322
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:50,699
oh,

1323
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:51,629
the homework machine,

1324
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,979
most perfect contraption that's ever been seen.

1325
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:55,260
Just put in your homework,

1326
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,419
then drop in a dime,

1327
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,399
snap on the switch,

1328
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,699
and in 10 seconds' time,

1329
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,270
your homework comes out quick and clean as can be.

1330
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,189
Here it is,

1331
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:03,040
9 + 4,

1332
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,780
and the answer is 33?

1333
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,580
Oh me,

1334
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,110
I guess it's not as perfect.

1335
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,550
As I thought it would be

1336
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,909
This then was CS 50.

1337
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:13,340
See you next time.
