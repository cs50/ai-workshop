0
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:03,970
All

1
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,269
right,

2
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,949
this is.

3
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,089
OK.

4
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,179
This is CS 50,

5
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:15,449
Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual Enterprises of

6
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,399
Computer Science and the arts of programming.

7
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,419
My name is David Malan,

8
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:19,610
and this is week er,

9
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,119
and by the end of today you'll know not only what these light bulbs here spell,

10
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,169
but so much more.

11
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,610
But why don't we start first with the,

12
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:25,809
uh,

13
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:28,520
the elephant or the elephant in the room,

14
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,080
that is artificial intelligence,

15
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:32,330
which is seemingly everywhere over the past few years,

16
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,770
and it's been said that it's going to change programming,

17
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,080
and that's absolutely the case.

18
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,250
It's been that way actually for the past several years.

19
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,485
is only going to get to be the case all the more,

20
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,654
but this is an incredibly exciting time.

21
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,925
This is actually a good thing,

22
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,914
I do think insofar as now using AI in any number of forms,

23
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,884
you can ask the computer to help solve some problem for you.

24
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,134
You can find some bug or mistake in your code.

25
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:53,854
Better still,

26
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:56,774
increasingly you can tell the AI what additional

27
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:58,804
features you want to add to your software,

28
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,145
and this is huge because even in the industry for years,

29
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,455
humans have been programming in some form for decades,

30
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,764
building products and solutions to problems.

31
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:06,054
The

32
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,619
is that you and I as humans have long been the bottleneck.

33
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,289
There's only so many hours in the day.

34
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:13,929
There's only so many people on your team or in your company,

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,020
and there's so many more bugs that you want to solve

36
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,210
and so many more features that you want to implement.

37
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,179
But at the same time you still really need to understand the fundamentals.

38
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,660
And indeed a class like this,

39
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,309
CS 50,

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,490
has never been about teaching you how to program.

41
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,410
Like that's actually one of the side effects of taking a class like this,

42
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,869
but the overarching goal is to teach you how to think,

43
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,300
how to take input and produce.

44
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,544
Correct output and how to master these and other tools.

45
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:38,854
And so by the end of the semester,

46
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:39,404
not only,

47
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,695
not only will you be acquainted with languages like Scratch,

48
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,815
which we'll touch on today if you've not seen it already,

49
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:47,544
languages like C and Python and SQL,

50
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,535
HTML CSS and JavaScript,

51
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:53,664
you'll be able to teach yourself new things ultimately and ultimately be able

52
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:57,065
to tell computers increasingly what it is you want it to do,

53
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:58,904
but you'll still be in the driver's seat,

54
00:03:58,985 --> 00:03:59,425
so to speak.

55
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,384
You'll be the pilot,

56
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:01,214
you'll be the conductor,

57
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,304
whatever your preferred metaphor.

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,449
And that's what I think is so empowering still about learning

59
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,750
introductory material,

60
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:07,899
foundational material,

61
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,990
because you'll know what you're ultimately talking about

62
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,500
and what you can in fact solve.

63
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,669
We've been through this before,

64
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,339
like when calculators came out,

65
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,190
it's still valuable,

66
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,790
I dare say all these years later to still

67
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,269
know how to do addition and subtraction and whatnot.

68
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,339
And yet I think back on some of my own math classes,

69
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,790
I remember learning so many darn ways in

70
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,309
college how to take derivatives and integrals.

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,429
And after like the 6th process of that,

72
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,149
I sort of realized,

73
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,350
OK,

74
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,739
I get it.

75
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,350
I get the idea.

76
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:32,144
Do I really need to know this many ways?

77
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,045
And here too,

78
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:34,834
with AI and with code,

79
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:39,554
can you increasingly sort of master the ideas and then lean on a copilot,

80
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:42,274
assistant to actually help you solve those same problems.

81
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,084
So let's do some of this ourselves here.

82
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:44,665
In fact,

83
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:48,665
just to give you a teaser of what you'll be able to do yourselves before long,

84
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:52,075
let me go ahead and open up a little something called Visual Studio Code,

85
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,984
AKA VS code for short.

86
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:54,964
This is popular,

87
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,434
largely open source or free software that's used by real world people.

88
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,670
In industry to write code and it's essentially a text editor similar to notepad,

89
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,480
if you're familiar with that or text edit,

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,559
kind of like Google Docs,

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,940
but no bold facing and underlining and things like

92
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,119
that that you'd find in word processing programs.

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
And this is CS 50's version thereof.

94
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,429
We're going to introduce you to this all the more next week,

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,119
but for now,

96
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,630
let's just give you a taste of what you can do with an environment like this.

97
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,190
So I'm going to switch over

98
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,910
to this program already running VS code,

99
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,160
and in this bottom of the screen,

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
you're going to see a so-called terminal.

101
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,005
Window again,

102
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:27,994
more on that next week,

103
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,285
but it's in this terminal window that I can write commands

104
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:32,274
that tells the computer what I want it to do.

105
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:33,135
For instance,

106
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:37,375
let's suppose just for the sake of discussion that I want to make my own chatbot,

107
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,684
not Chat GPT or Gemini and Claw.

108
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:39,875
Like,

109
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:41,714
let's make our own in some sense.

110
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:44,915
So I'm going to code up a program called chat.ie,

111
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:46,954
and you might be familiar that I,

112
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:50,355
I'm using a language here.ie is it's just called Python,

113
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:51,274
and if unfamiliar,

114
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:52,285
you're in good company.

115
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,954
You'll learn that too within a few weeks.

116
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:54,484
And at the top.

117
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,890
File here I can write my code and at the bottom of

118
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,040
the file of the window here I can run my code.

119
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:04,079
So here's how relatively easy it is nowadays to write even

120
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,359
your own chatbot using the AI technologies that we already have.

121
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm going to go ahead and type a command like import.

122
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,809
I'm going to go ahead and type the following

123
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,489
from OpenAI,

124
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,250
import OpenAI.

125
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,869
We'll learn what this means ultimately,

126
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,570
but what I'm going to do is write my own program on top of.

127
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,559
An API application programming interface that someone

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,709
else provides a big company called OpenAI,

129
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,959
and they're providing features and functionality that

130
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,790
now I can write code against.

131
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm going to create a so-called client,

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,230
which is to say a program of my own

133
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,269
that's going to use this OpenAI software.

134
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,750
And then I'm going to go ahead and ask this software for a response,

135
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:49,109
and I'm going to set that equal to client.pos.create,

136
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,440
whatever all that means,

137
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,950
and then Inside of these parentheses,

138
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:52,809
I'm going to say

139
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:53,660
the following.

140
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,299
The input I want to give to this underlying API is quote unquote something like

141
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,359
in one sentence,

142
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,149
what is CS 50?

143
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,179
Much like I would ask Chachi PT itself.

144
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:07,549
If you're familiar with things like Chat GPT and AI more generally nowadays,

145
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,779
you know,

146
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,929
there's this thing called models which are like statistical

147
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,220
models that ultimately drive what the AI's can do.

148
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,540
I'm gonna go ahead and say model equals quote unquote GPT 5,

149
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,269
which is the latest and greatest version at least as of today.

150
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,100
Now down in my terminal window I'm going to run a different command,

151
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,230
Python of chat.ie

152
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,410
and so long as I have made no typographical errors in this program,

153
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,290
I should be able to ask OpenAI,

154
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,459
not with Chat GPT.com,

155
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,959
but with my own code

156
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,570
for the answer to some question.

157
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,760
But I want to know what the answer to that question is,

158
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:39,540
so I actually want.

159
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:43,214
Print out that response by saying print response

160
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,734
output text.

161
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,385
In other words,

162
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,345
these 10 lines,

163
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:48,415
and it's not even 10 lines because a few of them are blank,

164
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:52,184
I've implemented my own chatbot that at the moment is hard coded,

165
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:54,545
that is permanently configured to only answer

166
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,184
one question for me.

167
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,940
And let's see with the cross of the fingers.

168
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,950
CS 50 is Harvard University's introductory computer science course,

169
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:04,790
the intellectual enterprises of Computer Science and the Art of programming.

170
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,579
Weirdly familiar,

171
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,950
covering problem solving algorithms,

172
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,510
data structures,

173
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,750
and more using languages like CPython and SQL.

174
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,140
OK,

175
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,920
interesting,

176
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,470
but let's make the program itself more dynamic.

177
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,829
Suppose you wanted to write code that actually

178
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,700
asks the human what their question is,

179
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,269
because very quickly might we want to learn

180
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,100
something more than just this one question.

181
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:22,790
So up here,

182
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,989
I'm going to go and change my code and type some.

183
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,899
Like this

184
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,890
type prompt equals

185
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,649
input with parentheses.

186
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:31,209
More on this another time too,

187
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,820
but what I'm going to ask the user for is to give me an actual prompt.

188
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,369
That is a question that I want this AI to answer.

189
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,609
And down here,

190
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,369
what you'll notice,

191
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:41,250
even if you've never programmed before,

192
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,419
is that I can do something somewhat intuitive insofar as

193
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,729
line 5 is now asking the human for input.

194
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,770
Let's just stipulate that this equal sign means store that answer

195
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,849
in a variable called prompt,

196
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,099
where variables just like in math.

197
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,059
Y or Z.

198
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's go ahead and store that in prompt.

199
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,650
So the input I want to give to OpenAI now is that actual prompt.

200
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,630
So it's a placeholder containing whatever keystrokes the human typed in.

201
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,690
If I now run that same command again,

202
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,070
Python of chat.ie,

203
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,619
hit enter,

204
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:09,609
cross my fingers,

205
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,640
I'll see now

206
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:11,950
dynamic

207
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,880
prompting.

208
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,599
So what's the question I might want to ask?

209
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:14,729
Well,

210
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,090
let's just say it again in one sentence,

211
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:17,799
whoops,

212
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:18,909
in one sentence,

213
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,809
what is CS 50 mark?

214
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:21,369
Enter.

215
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,219
And now the answer comes back as

216
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,450
probably

217
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,340
roughly

218
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,030
the same but a little bit different,

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,119
a variant thereof,

220
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,190
but maybe we can distill this even more succinctly.

221
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,460
How about let's run it again?

222
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,059
Python of chat.pi and let's say in one word

223
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,739
what is CS 50 and see if the underlying AI obliges.

224
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:42,460
And

225
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,229
After a pause

226
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,570
course in a word,

227
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,039
so that's not all that incorrect,

228
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,869
and maybe we can have a little fun with this now.

229
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,109
How about in one word,

230
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,830
which is,

231
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,150
which is better?

232
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,190
maybe Harvard

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,020
or Stanford Question mark.

234
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,549
Hope you picked right.

235
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,179
Let's see.

236
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,359
The answer is.

237
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,409
Depends.

238
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,020
OK,

239
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,179
so would not in fact oblige,

240
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,190
but notice what I keep doing in this code.

241
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,609
I keep providing a prompt as the human like in one sentence,

242
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,409
in one word.

243
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:15,640
Well,

244
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,250
if you want the AI to behave in a certain way,

245
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,539
why don't we just tell the underlying system to behave in that way

246
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,659
so why the human don't have to keep asking it in one sentence,

247
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:24,969
in one sentence in one word,

248
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,020
so we can actually introduce one other feature

249
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,530
that you'll hear discussed in industry nowadays,

250
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:30,609
which is not only

251
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,140
a prompt from the user,

252
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,619
which I'm gonna.

253
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:36,677
Now temporarily renamed to user prompt just to make clear it's coming from the user.

254
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:41,916
I'm going to also give our what's called a system prompt by setting this equal to some

255
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:45,577
standardized instructions that I want the AI

256
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:46,517
to respect,

257
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:50,877
like limit your answer to one sentence,

258
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:51,697
quote unquote.

259
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,796
And now in addition to passing in as input,

260
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,276
the user prompt,

261
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:57,976
I'm going to actually tell OpenI.

262
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,213
to use these instructions coming from this other variable

263
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:03,823
called System prompt.

264
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:04,463
So in other words,

265
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,643
I'm still using the same underlying service,

266
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:09,174
but I'm handing it now not only what the user typed in,

267
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:12,703
but also this standardized text limit your answer to one sentence

268
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:15,333
so the human like me doesn't have to do that anymore.

269
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:16,893
Let's now go back to my terminal,

270
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:19,054
Run Python of chat.ie once more,

271
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,883
and this time we'll be prompted,

272
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:23,463
but now I can just ask what is CS 50 question.

273
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:23,620
And

274
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,351
I'll likely get

275
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:28,630
a correct and similar

276
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,151
answer to before.

277
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:31,681
And indeed it's Harvard University's

278
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,200
flagship introductory computer science course.

279
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,330
So it seems spot on too.

280
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,341
But now we can have some fun with this too,

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,060
and you might know that these GPTs nowadays have sort of personalities.

282
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,390
You can make them obliged to behave in one way or another.

283
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:47,611
Why don't we go into our system prompt here and say something silly like pretend

284
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:48,921
you're a cat.

285
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,559
And now let's go back to the prompt one final time.

286
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,109
Run Python of chat.ie

287
00:11:54,729 --> 00:12:00,200
prompt again will be say what is CS 50 and with a final flourish of hitting enter.

288
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,119
What do we get back?

289
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,659
CS 50 is Harvard University's introductory

290
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,059
computer science course teaching programming,

291
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,460
algorithms,

292
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,919
data structures,

293
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,539
and problem solving,

294
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,109
and it's available free online

295
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,900
meow.

296
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,940
So that was enough to coerce this particular behavior.

297
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:20,250
So this is to say that with programming you have the ability in like 10 lines of text,

298
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:21,940
not all of which you might understand yet,

299
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,849
but that's the whole point of a class like this to build fairly powerful things,

300
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,330
maybe silly things like this,

301
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,500
but in fact it's using the same primitives that CS 50 has its own.

302
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:33,455
Virtual rubber duck and we'll talk more about this in the weeks to come,

303
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:34,375
but long story short,

304
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:35,705
in the world of programming,

305
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:36,645
it's kind of a thing

306
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:40,776
to keep a rubber duck literally on your desk or really any inanimate

307
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:44,276
cute object like this because when you are struggling with some problems,

308
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,325
some bug or mistake in your code and you don't have a friend,

309
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,335
a teaching assistant,

310
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:48,906
a parent,

311
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,875
or someone else who's more knowledgeable than you.

312
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:53,521
About code where you literally are encouraged in programming

313
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:56,202
circles to like talk to the rubber duck,

314
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:59,192
and it's through that process of just verbalizing your confusion

315
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,242
and organizing your thoughts enough to convey it to another person or duck in

316
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,161
this case that so often that proverbial light bulb goes off and you realize,

317
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:06,351
ah,

318
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:11,081
I'm being an idiot now I hear in my own thoughts the illogic or the mistake I'm making.

319
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,440
And you solve that problem as well.

320
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,289
So CS 50,

321
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:15,369
drawing inspiration from this,

322
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:18,599
will give to you a virtual duck in computer form.

323
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:19,090
And in fact,

324
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,289
among the other URLs you'll use over the course of the semester is that here,

325
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,570
CS50.AI,

326
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,960
which is also built into that previous URL,

327
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,690
CS50.

328
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:27,210
dev,

329
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,010
whereby these are the AIs you can use in CS50

330
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,359
to solve problems and you are encouraged to do so.

331
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:34,809
As you'll see in the course of syllabus,

332
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:35,919
it is not reasonable.

333
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,312
Not allowed to use AI-based software other than CS 50's own,

334
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:39,971
be it Claw,

335
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:40,341
Gemini,

336
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:41,132
Chachi PT,

337
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:41,581
or the like,

338
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:44,541
but it is reasonable and very much encouraged along the

339
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,622
way to turn not only to humans like me,

340
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,892
your teaching assistant,

341
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:49,171
and others in the class,

342
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,351
but to CS 50's own AI-based software.

343
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:56,541
And what you'll find is that this virtual duck is designed to behave as close to a good

344
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:00,981
human tutor as you might expect from an actual human in the real world knows about CS.

345
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:02,984
knows how to lead you to a solution,

346
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:07,064
ideally without simply spoiling it and providing it outright.

347
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:08,903
So with that said,

348
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:12,473
that's sort of the end game to be able to write code like that and more.

349
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:16,213
But let's really start back at the beginning and see how we can't get

350
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,684
from zeros and ones that computers speak

351
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,033
all the way back to artificial intelligence.

352
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,914
So computer science is in the name of the course,

353
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:24,914
Computer Science 50,

354
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:25,473
but what is that?

355
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:25,674
Well,

356
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:27,366
it's really Just the study of information.

357
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:28,835
How do you represent it?

358
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:29,966
How do you process it?

359
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,526
and very much germane to computer science

360
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:33,406
is what the world calls computational thinking,

361
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:36,716
which is just the application of ideas from computer science,

362
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:40,476
or CS to problems generally in the real world.

363
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:41,606
And in fact that's ultimately,

364
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:44,166
I dare say what computer science really is.

365
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:47,046
It's about problem solving and even though we use computers,

366
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,885
you learn how to program along the way,

367
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,846
these are really just tools and methodologies.

368
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:53,857
that you can leverage to solve problems.

369
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:54,888
Now what does that mean?

370
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:55,138
Well,

371
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:59,127
a problem is perhaps most easily distilled into a simple picture like this.

372
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:00,148
We've got some input,

373
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:01,728
which is like the problem we want to solve,

374
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:02,607
and the output,

375
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:04,968
which is the goal we want the solution there too.

376
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,528
And then somewhere in the middle here is the proverbial black box,

377
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:09,728
the sort of secret sauce that gets that input

378
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:10,737
from output.

379
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:14,038
So this then I would say is in essence is problem solving

380
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,528
and thus computer science.

381
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,169
But we have to agree,

382
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,609
especially if we're going to use devices,

383
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:18,940
Macs,

384
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,409
PCs,

385
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:19,609
phones,

386
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,140
whatever,

387
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,169
how do we all represent information,

388
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,969
the inputs and the outputs in some standardized way?

389
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,849
Is it with English?

390
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,700
Is it with something else?

391
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:26,890
Well,

392
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:27,700
you all probably know,

393
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,200
even if you're not computer people,

394
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,359
that at the end of the day

395
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,530
computers somehow use zeros in one entirely.

396
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:35,325
That is their entire alphabet.

397
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:36,275
And in fact

398
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:39,085
you might be familiar already with certain such systems.

399
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,205
So the unary notation,

400
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:44,804
which means you essentially use single digits like fingers on your hand,

401
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:45,205
for instance,

402
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,835
unary AKA base one,

403
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:48,405
is something you can do on your own human hand.

404
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:49,114
So for instance,

405
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:49,965
with one human hand,

406
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:50,965
how high can I count?

407
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:52,429
All right,

408
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,820
so hopefully 12345,

409
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:59,409
and if you want to count to 6 to 11 and 10 and so forth,

410
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,969
you need to,

411
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,200
you know,

412
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,349
take out another hand or your toes or the like because it's fairly limiting.

413
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,200
But if I think a little harder instead of just using unary,

414
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,900
what if I use a different system instead?

415
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,469
What about something like binary?

416
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:10,630
Well,

417
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,289
how high if you think a little harder,

418
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,859
can you count on one human hand?

419
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,109
So 31,

420
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:17,989
says someone who studied computer science before,

421
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:18,880
but why is that?

422
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,070
It's kind of hard to imagine,

423
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:20,510
right?

424
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,799
Because 12345 seems to be the five possible patterns,

425
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,119
but that's only when you're looking at the totality of fingers

426
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,640
that are actually up 5 in total or 4 in total,

427
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,830
or 1 or the like.

428
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,719
But what if we take into account the pattern of fingers that

429
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,890
are up and we just standardize what each of those fingers represent?

430
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,000
So maybe we all agree.

431
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,859
Like a good computer would too,

432
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,539
that maybe no fingers up means the number 0.

433
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,869
And if we want to count to 1,

434
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,119
let's go with the obvious.

435
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,320
This is now 1.

436
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,169
But instead of 2 being this,

437
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,640
which was my first instinct,

438
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,599
maybe 2 can just be

439
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,359
this

440
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,400
a single second finger up like this,

441
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,010
and that means we could now use 2 fingers up to represent 3.

442
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:06,472
I propose we can use just one middle finger up to offend everyone but represent 4.

443
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:13,261
I could maybe use these two fingers with some difficulty to represent 567.

444
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:16,261
I'm already up to 7 having used only 3 fingers.

445
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:16,671
And in fact,

446
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:18,381
if we keep going higher and higher,

447
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:23,001
I bet I can get as high as 31 for 32 possible combinations,

448
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:23,871
but the first one was.

449
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,874
So that's as high as we can count.

450
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,773
So we'll make this connection in just a moment,

451
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,583
but what I started to do there is something called base 2.

452
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:33,004
Instead of just having fingers up or fingers down,

453
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:35,933
I'm taking into account the positions of those fingers

454
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:39,014
and giving meaning to like this finger here,

455
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:39,854
this finger here,

456
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,723
this finger here,

457
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:41,213
and so forth,

458
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:42,764
different weights if you will.

459
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:43,404
So

460
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:46,654
the binary system is indeed all computers.

461
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,755
And you might be familiar with some terminology here.

462
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,265
Binary digit is not really something anyone really says,

463
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,865
but the shorthand for that is going to be

464
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:55,556
bit.

465
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,076
So if you've heard of bits,

466
00:17:57,105 --> 00:17:59,355
and we'll soon see bytes and then kilobytes

467
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:02,026
and megabytes and gigabytes and terabytes and more,

468
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:05,745
this just refers to a bit meaning a single

469
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,196
binary digit,

470
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:09,475
either a 0 or a 1.

471
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,920
A 0 is perhaps most simply represented by just like turning,

472
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,359
maybe keeping a finger down,

473
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,369
or in the world of computers which have access to electricity,

474
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:19,479
be it from the wall

475
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,239
or maybe a battery,

476
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,589
you know what we could do?

477
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,829
We could just decide sort of universally that when

478
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,359
a light bulb is off,

479
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,849
that thing represents a zero,

480
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:29,650
and when the light bulb.

481
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:32,994
Was on that thing's going to represent a 1 instead.

482
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:34,084
Now why is this?

483
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:34,244
Well,

484
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,724
electricity is such a simple thing,

485
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:35,885
right?

486
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:38,114
It's either flowing or it's not,

487
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:41,305
and we don't even have to therefore worry about how much of it is flowing.

488
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:43,915
If you're vaguely remember a little bit about voltage,

489
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,675
we can sort of be like zero volts.

490
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,045
Nothing's there available for us,

491
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:49,444
or maybe it's 5 volts or something else in between.

492
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,939
But what's nice about binary only housing zeros and ones is that it maps really

493
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:58,290
nicely to the real world by like throwing a light switch on and off.

494
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,420
You can represent information by just using a

495
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,819
little bit of electricity or the lack thereof.

496
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,229
So what do I mean by this?

497
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,500
Well,

498
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,660
suppose we want to start counting using binary zeros and ones only.

499
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:09,810
Well,

500
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,180
let's think of them metaphorically as like akin to these light.

501
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:15,446
Bulbs here and in fact let me grab a few of these light bulbs

502
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,475
and let me propose that if we want to represent the number 0,

503
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:18,885
well,

504
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:21,115
it stands to reason that here

505
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:25,595
single light bulb that is off can be agreed upon as representing 0.

506
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,526
Now in practice,

507
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,645
computers don't have little light bulbs inside,

508
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,235
but they do have little switches inside,

509
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,686
millions of tiny little things called transistors that have.

510
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,832
On can allow it to capture a little bit of electricity and

511
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:41,271
effectively turn on a metaphorical bulb or the switch can go off.

512
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,232
The transistor can go off and therefore let the

513
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,271
electricity dissipate and you have just now a 0.

514
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:47,421
Unfortunately,

515
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:49,222
even though I can let some

516
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:50,501
electricity,

517
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:53,381
here's the battery I mentioned is required,

518
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,911
even though we might have some electricity available to us,

519
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,342
I can therefore count to 1.

520
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,151
But how do I go about counting?

521
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,290
Hardware problem,

522
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,699
how do I go about counting higher than one

523
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:06,540
with just a light bulb?

524
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,579
Yeah,

525
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,380
so I need more of them.

526
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,250
So let me grab another one here,

527
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:13,170
and now I can put it next to it,

528
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:16,050
and this too I'll claim is just still the number one.

529
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,930
But if I want to turn 2 of them on,

530
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,400
well,

531
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,140
that would mean I could count to 2.

532
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,550
And if I maybe grab another one now I can count as high as 3,

533
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:24,369
but wait a minute,

534
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm doing something wrong

535
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:27,219
because with 3 human fingers,

536
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,650
how high was they able to count.

537
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:31,829
So 7 in total starting at 0.

538
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:33,339
So I've done something wrong here,

539
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,930
but let me be a little more clever than about the pattern that I'm actually using.

540
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,650
Perhaps this can still be

541
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,410
1,

542
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:44,770
but just like my finger went up and only one finger in the second version of this,

543
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,839
this

544
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,140
can be what we represent as 2.

545
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,729
Which one do I want to turn on as 3,

546
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,119
your left or your right?

547
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:53,920
So you're right,

548
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:56,579
because now this matches what I was doing with my fingers a moment ago,

549
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,030
and I claimed we could represent 3 like this.

550
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,189
If we want to represent 4,

551
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:00,719
that's fine.

552
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,109
We have to turn that off,

553
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,270
this off,

554
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,040
and this on,

555
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,750
and that's somehow 4

556
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,199
and let's go all the way up to 7.

557
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,640
Which ones need to be on to represent the number 7?

558
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,520
All right,

559
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,030
so all of them here.

560
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,949
Now if you're not among those who just sort of naturally said

561
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:16,599
all of them,

562
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:17,839
like what the heck is going on?

563
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,439
How do half the people in this room know what these patterns are supposed to be?

564
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:21,640
Well,

565
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,469
maybe you're remembering what I did with my fingers,

566
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,569
but it turns out you're already pretty familiar

567
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,310
with systems like this,

568
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,150
even if you might not have put a name to it.

569
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,180
So in the human world,

570
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:30,839
the real world,

571
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,589
most of us deal every day with

572
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,520
the so-called base 10 system,

573
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,329
otherwise known as.

574
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,250
deck implying 10 because in the decimal system you have 10 digits available to you 0

575
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,369
through 9.

576
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:45,449
In the binary system we only had 2 by implying 2,

577
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,010
so 0 and 1.

578
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,869
And unary we had just 1,

579
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:51,410
a single digit there or not.

580
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:55,489
So in the decimal system we just have more of a vocabulary to play with,

581
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,699
and yet you and I have been doing this since grade school.

582
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,020
So this is obviously the number 123.

583
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,170
But why?

584
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,969
It's technically just three symbols 123,

585
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,780
but most of us,

586
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,839
your mind immediately goes,

587
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,109
OK,

588
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,329
123,

589
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,020
pretty obvious,

590
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:08,890
pretty natural.

591
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,380
But at some point you,

592
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:10,819
like me,

593
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,329
were probably taught that this is the one's place

594
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,130
and this is the ten's place and this is the 100s place and so forth.

595
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:21,359
And the reason that this pattern of symbols

596
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:26,020
123 is 123 is that we're all doing some quick mental math and.

597
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,380
I,

598
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,571
well,

599
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:30,500
that's 100 times 1 plus 10 times 2 plus 1 times 30,

600
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:30,821
OK,

601
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,500
there's how we get 100 plus 20 + 3 gives

602
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,931
us the number we all know mathematically is 123.

603
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,220
Well,

604
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,020
it turns out whether you're using decimal or binary or other

605
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,171
base systems that we'll talk about later in the course,

606
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,090
the system is still fundamentally the same.

607
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,541
Let's kind of generalize this away.

608
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:49,461
Here's a three digit number in some base system,

609
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,421
specifically in decimal,

610
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:51,821
and I know that only because of

611
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:54,712
Placeholders that I've got on top of each of these numbers.

612
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,332
But if we do a little bit of math here,

613
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:56,921
1,

614
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:57,281
10,

615
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:57,982
100,

616
00:22:58,141 --> 00:22:58,741
1000,

617
00:22:58,751 --> 00:22:59,342
10,000,

618
00:22:59,352 --> 00:22:59,781
and so forth,

619
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:00,682
what's the pattern?

620
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:00,702
Well,

621
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:02,822
technically this is 100,

622
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:03,751
10 to 1,

623
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:04,891
10 to 2,

624
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,052
and so forth,

625
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:11,822
and we're using 10 because we can use as many as 10 digits under each of those columns.

626
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:15,852
But if we take some of those digits away and go from decimal down to binary,

627
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,542
the motivation being it's Way easier for

628
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:22,103
a computer to distinguish electricity being on or

629
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:26,623
off than coming up with like 10 unique levels of electricity to distinguish among.

630
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:27,453
You could do it.

631
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:30,493
It would be annoying and difficult to build and hardware you could do it

632
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:32,652
so much simpler to just say

633
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:34,223
on and off.

634
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,233
It's a nice simple world that way.

635
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:37,692
So let's change the base

636
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,292
from 10 to 2,

637
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:40,463
and what does this get us?

638
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:40,583
Well,

639
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:41,953
if we now do undo the math,

640
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:43,223
that's 2 to 0.

641
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:46,654
121 is 222 is 4.

642
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:49,734
So the the mental math is now about to be the same,

643
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:53,034
but the columns represent something a little bit different.

644
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:53,784
So for instance,

645
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,904
if I turn all of these off again,

646
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:57,494
such that I've got off,

647
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:57,793
off,

648
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:58,374
off,

649
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,254
otherwise known as 000,

650
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:08,183
it's 0 because it's 4 times 0 + 2 times 0 + 1 times 0 still gives me 0.

651
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:08,943
By contrast,

652
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:13,214
If I turn on maybe just this one all the way over on the left,

653
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:13,655
well,

654
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:15,905
that's 4 times 1

655
00:24:16,344 --> 00:24:18,814
because on represents 1 and off represents 0,

656
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:21,035
plus 2 times 0 plus 1 times 0,

657
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:22,214
that gives me 4.

658
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,125
And if I turn both of these on

659
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:26,834
such that all three of them are now on,

660
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:27,265
on,

661
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:27,505
on,

662
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:27,925
on,

663
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:30,385
AKA 111,

664
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:34,714
that's 4 times 1 plus 2 times 1 plus 1 times 1.

665
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,319
That then gives me 7,

666
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,479
and we can keep adding more and more bits to this.

667
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:38,719
In fact,

668
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,959
if we go all the way up

669
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,930
numerically,

670
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,150
here's how we would represent in binary the number you and I know as 0.

671
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:46,650
Here's how we would represent

672
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,469
1.

673
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,229
Here's how we would represent 2

674
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,430
and 3

675
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,469
and 4 and 5,

676
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,800
and you can kind of see in your mind's eyes.

677
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:55,844
Now because I only have zeros and

678
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,055
ones and no 2s or threes,

679
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:59,324
not to mention nines,

680
00:24:59,405 --> 00:25:02,895
I'm essentially going to be carrying a 1 in a moment if we were to be doing some math.

681
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,155
So to go from 5

682
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:05,234
to 6,

683
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:11,314
that's why the 1 ends up in the middle column to go to 7 here gives us now 111 or on on

684
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:11,525
on,

685
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:12,805
how do I represent 8?

686
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:16,180
Using ones and zeros,

687
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,739
yeah,

688
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:18,589
yeah,

689
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,189
so we're going to need to add another digit.

690
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,140
We need to throw hardware at the problem using an additional

691
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,109
digit so that we actually have a column representing 8.

692
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,380
Now,

693
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,030
as an aside,

694
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,420
and we'll talk about this before long,

695
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,619
if you don't have an additional digit available,

696
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,550
if your computer doesn't have enough memory,

697
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,339
so to speak,

698
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,760
you might accidentally count from 01234567.

699
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:40,209
And then accidentally

700
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,650
end up back at 0 because if there's no room to store

701
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,099
the 4th bit,

702
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:45,619
well,

703
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,619
all you have is part of the number,

704
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,130
and this is going to create all sorts of problems then ultimately in the real world.

705
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,130
So let me go ahead and put these back and propose that we have a system now

706
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,369
if you agree to sort of count numbers in this way via which we can represent

707
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,180
information in some standard way and all the device underneath the hood.

708
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,329
It is a bit of electricity to make this work.

709
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,800
It's got to be able to turn things on,

710
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,449
AKA use some transistors,

711
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:11,890
and it's got to be able to turn those things

712
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,959
off so as to represent zeros instead of ones.

713
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,890
But the reality is like 2 bits,

714
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:18,449
3 bits,

715
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,790
4 bits aren't very useful in the real world because even with 3 bits you can count to 7,

716
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,359
with 4 you can count to 15.

717
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:25,969
These aren't very big numbers,

718
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,530
so it tends to be more common to actually use units of measure of 8 bits at a time.

719
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:33,510
A byte is just that.

720
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,359
1 byte is 8 bits.

721
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,680
So if you've ever used the vernacular of kilobytes,

722
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,369
megabytes,

723
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,199
gigabytes,

724
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,680
that's just referring to some number of bits,

725
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,229
but

726
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,510
8 of them

727
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,380
together compose one individual byte.

728
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,930
So here for instance is a byte worth of bits,

729
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:50,989
8 of them total.

730
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,069
I've added all the additional placeholders,

731
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,199
and what number does this represent in decimal

732
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,800
even though you're looking at 8 binary digits.

733
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,479
It's just 0,

734
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,109
because like literally every column is a 0.

735
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,869
Now this is a bit more of mental math,

736
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,270
but unless you know it already,

737
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,239
what if I change all of the zeros to ones?

738
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,630
I turn all 8 light bulbs on,

739
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,550
what number is this?

740
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,089
Yeah,

741
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,449
so 255.

742
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,969
Now some of those of you who didn't get that instantly,

743
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,410
that's fine.

744
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:16,930
You could certainly do the math manually.

745
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,890
I dare say some of you have some prior knowledge of how to do this sort of system,

746
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,329
but 255 means

747
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:26,949
that if you start counting at 0 and you go all the way up to 255.

748
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:27,194
OK,

749
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:30,635
that's 256 total possibilities.

750
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:34,584
Once you include 0 in the total number of patterns of zeros and ones,

751
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:37,864
and this is just going to be one of these common numbers in computer science,

752
00:27:37,994 --> 00:27:39,224
256.

753
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:39,584
Why?

754
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:42,114
Because it's referring to 8 of something,

755
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:43,114
2 to 8.

756
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,479
Gives you 256 and so you're going to commonly see certain values like that.

757
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,020
256 back in the day,

758
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,599
computers could only show 256 colors on the screen.

759
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,640
Certain graphics formats nowadays that you might download can

760
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,349
only use as many as 256 colors because,

761
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,069
as we'll see,

762
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,310
they're only using,

763
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,089
for instance,

764
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:03,920
8 bits and therefore they can only represent so

765
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,430
many colors of the rainbow as a result.

766
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:07,689
So

767
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,599
this

768
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,819
then is how we might go from just zeros and ones,

769
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,589
electricity inside of a computer

770
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,400
to storing actual numbers with which we're familiar

771
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,209
and honestly we can go higher than 255.

772
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,599
What do you need to count higher than 255?

773
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:21,300
1/9 bit,

774
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:22,050
a 10th bit,

775
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:25,959
11th bit and so forth and it turns out common conventions nowadays,

776
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,040
and we'll see this in code 2 is to use as many as 32 bits at a time.

777
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,160
So that's a good chunk of bits and anyone want to ballpark how

778
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,670
high you can count if you've got 32 bits available to you.

779
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:40,079
Oh,

780
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,069
fewer people now,

781
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:41,280
yeah,

782
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:41,869
in the back.

783
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,020
Yeah,

784
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,510
so it's roughly 4 billion,

785
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,339
and it's technically 2 billion if you also want to represent negative numbers,

786
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:49,729
but we'll revisit that question,

787
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,209
but 2 to 32nd power is roughly 4 billion.

788
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:53,650
However,

789
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:56,300
nowadays it's even more common with the Macs and PCs

790
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,489
you might have on your laps and even your phones nowadays

791
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:00,540
to use 64 bits,

792
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,819
which is a big enough number that I'm not even sure offhand how to pronounce it.

793
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,859
That's a lot of permutations that.

794
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:08,503
2 to 64 possible permutations,

795
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:10,172
but that's increasingly commonplace.

796
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:10,942
And as an aside,

797
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,042
just to dovetail things with our discussion of AI,

798
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:16,022
among the reasons that we're living through over these past few years,

799
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:19,262
especially this crazy interesting time of AI,

800
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:19,973
is because

801
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,642
computers have been getting so much faster,

802
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:24,412
exponentially so over time.

803
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:26,542
They have so much more memory available to them.

804
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:29,022
There's so much data out there on the internet in particular.

805
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:33,786
to train these models that it's an interesting confluence of hardware now actually

806
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:37,056
meeting the mathematics and statistics that we'll talk about later in the class

807
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:41,215
that ultimately make tools like the cat we just built possible.

808
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,056
But of course computers are not all math,

809
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,015
and in fact we'll use very little math per se in this class.

810
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:48,306
And so let's move away pretty quickly from just zeros

811
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:50,026
and ones and talk about letters of the alphabet,

812
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:50,895
say in English.

813
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,105
Here is the letter A.

814
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:55,589
Suppose you want to use this letter in an email,

815
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,219
a text message,

816
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,380
or any other program.

817
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,699
What is the computer doing underneath the hood?

818
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:04,869
How can the computer store a capital letter A in English if at the end of the

819
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:10,479
day all the computer has access to is a source of electricity from the wall or from

820
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,619
a battery,

821
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:15,300
and it has a lot of switches that it can turn on and off

822
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,390
and treat the electricity in units of 8 or 32 or 64 or whatever.

823
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,619
How might a computer represent a letter A?

824
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:26,430
Yeah,

825
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:27,790
we need to give it an identity,

826
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:28,339
so to speak,

827
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,319
as an integer.

828
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:29,790
In other words,

829
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,780
at the end of the day,

830
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,790
if your entire canvas,

831
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:33,579
so to speak,

832
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,390
consists only of zeros and ones,

833
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,859
like that is going to be the answer to every question today.

834
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,150
You only have zeros and ones as the solution to these problems.

835
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,420
We just need to agree

836
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,599
what pattern of zeros and ones and therefore what integer,

837
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,579
what number shall be used to represent the letter A.

838
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,560
And hopefully,

839
00:30:50,844 --> 00:30:54,305
When we look at that pattern of zeros and ones in the right context,

840
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:55,685
we'll indeed see it as an A.

841
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:57,114
So if we look inside of a computer,

842
00:30:57,204 --> 00:30:57,834
so to speak,

843
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:00,405
in the context of like a text messaging program

844
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:02,635
or a word processor or anything like that,

845
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,915
that pattern shall be interpreted hopefully as a capital letter A.

846
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:09,954
But if I open up Mac OS's or Windows or my phone's calculator program,

847
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:14,194
I would want that same pattern of zeros and ones to be interpreted instead

848
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:14,885
as a.

849
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,030
If I open up Photoshop,

850
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,869
as we'll soon see,

851
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,859
I want that same pattern of zeros and ones to be interpreted as a color presumably,

852
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:24,780
not to mention videos and sound and so forth,

853
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,500
but it's all just zeros and ones.

854
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,619
And so even though I,

855
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,170
when writing that chat program a few minutes ago,

856
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,489
didn't have to worry about telling the computer,

857
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,619
oh this is text,

858
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:34,430
this is a number,

859
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,449
this is something else,

860
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,140
we'll see as we write code ourselves that

861
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,954
you as the programmer will Have control over telling

862
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:45,395
the computer how to treat some pattern of zeros and ones telling it this is a number,

863
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:46,224
this is a color,

864
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,145
this is a letter or something else.

865
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:48,165
Um,

866
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:50,864
how do we represent the letter A?

867
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:50,984
Well,

868
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,795
it turns out a bunch of humans in a room years ago decided that this

869
00:31:54,795 --> 00:32:00,944
pattern of zeros and ones shall be known globally as a capital letter English A.

870
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,675
What is that number if you do the quick mental math?

871
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:08,939
So indeed 65 because we had a 1 in the 604s place and a 1 in the one's place.

872
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,780
So 65,

873
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:10,770
that's just sort of it.

874
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,420
It would have been nice if it were just the number 1 or maybe the number 0,

875
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,060
but at least after the capital letter A,

876
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:19,390
they kept things consistent such that

877
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:21,530
if you want to represent a letter B,

878
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:23,410
it's going to be 66.

879
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,739
C,

880
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,250
it's going to be 67 Y because.

881
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:26,802
The humans in this room,

882
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,083
a bunch of Americans at the time,

883
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,812
standardized on what's called ASCI,

884
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:32,572
the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

885
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:34,522
It doesn't matter what the acronym represents,

886
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:35,192
but

887
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,652
it was just a mapping.

888
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,253
Someone on a piece of paper essentially

889
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:40,142
started writing down letters of the alphabet

890
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,522
and corresponding numbers so that computers subsequently could all speak

891
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:48,326
that same standard representation and Here's an excerpt thereof.

892
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:49,926
In this case we're seeing 7 bits' worth,

893
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:53,836
but eventually we ended up using 8 bits in total to represent letters,

894
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:55,485
and some of these are fairly cryptic,

895
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:56,875
maybe more on those other time,

896
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:58,885
but down here if we highlight just one column,

897
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:02,845
we'll see that indeed on this cheat sheet 65 is capital A,

898
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,166
66 is B,

899
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,355
67 is C,

900
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:06,235
and so forth.

901
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,566
So why don't we do a little exercise here.

902
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:09,619
What

903
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,510
pattern of zeros and ones do I see here?

904
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,869
I've got 3 bytes,

905
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,750
so 3 sets of 8 bits,

906
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,430
and even though there's no placeholders now over the columns,

907
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:19,310
what is this?

908
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,229
Number

909
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,640
It's 60.

910
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:25,550
Yeah,

911
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,510
so we've got the 1s,

912
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:26,989
2s,

913
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,589
4s,

914
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:28,339
8s,

915
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,660
1632,

916
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:32,430
64s column.

917
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,900
So indeed this is going to be the number

918
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,260
72,

919
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:35,829
72.

920
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,869
This is not what computer scientists spend their day doing.

921
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,180
This is just to reinforce what it is we just looked at,

922
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:40,959
and I'll spoil it.

923
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:42,880
The rest of these numbers are 72,

924
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:43,969
73,

925
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:44,579
33,

926
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,430
and anyone in this room could have done that if you took out a piece of paper,

927
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,619
figured out what the columns are,

928
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,989
and just do a bit of quick or.

929
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:51,545
Of mental or written math,

930
00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:52,665
but this is to say,

931
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:55,464
suppose that you just got a text message or an email

932
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:59,314
that if you had the ability to look underneath the hood of the computer and

933
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:03,185
see what pattern of zeros and ones did you just receive over the internet,

934
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:07,385
suppose that pattern of zeros and ones was 3 bytes of bits,

935
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:10,465
which when you do the math are the numbers 72,

936
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:11,353
73,

937
00:34:11,364 --> 00:34:12,205
33.

938
00:34:12,274 --> 00:34:12,353
Well,

939
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:13,274
here's the cheat sheet again.

940
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:14,725
What message did you just get?

941
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,228
Yeah,

942
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,138
so it's high.

943
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:17,498
Why?

944
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,779
Because 72 is H and 73 is I.

945
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,938
Now some of you said hi fairly emphatically why.

946
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:24,349
Well,

947
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,947
33 turns out you wouldn't know this unless you looked

948
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:29,947
it up or someone told you is an exclamation point.

949
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,309
So literally if you were to text someone like right now,

950
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:33,299
if you haven't already,

951
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,908
HI exclamation point in all caps.

952
00:34:36,013 --> 00:34:40,434
You would essentially be sending 3 bytes of information somehow over the internet

953
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:45,373
to that recipient and because their phone similarly understands ASCI

954
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:47,914
because it was programmed years ago to do so,

955
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:52,444
it knows to show you HI exclamation point and not a number,

956
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:53,592
3 numbers no less,

957
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:55,924
or colors or something else altogether.

958
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,070
So here we then have high,

959
00:34:58,459 --> 00:34:59,889
3 digits in a row here.

960
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:01,820
What else is worth noting here?

961
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:01,979
Well,

962
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,780
there's some fun

963
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,739
sort of trivia embedded even in this cheat sheet.

964
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,300
So here again is A,

965
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:07,540
B,

966
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:07,820
C,

967
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:08,030
D,

968
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,260
E,

969
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,530
F,

970
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:08,689
G,

971
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:09,350
and so forth,

972
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,889
65 on down.

973
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,649
Let me just highlight over here

974
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,169
the lowercase letters 97,

975
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,110
98,

976
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:16,979
99,

977
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,850
and so forth.

978
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,370
If I go back and forth,

979
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,729
does anyone notice

980
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,719
the consistent pattern between these two?

981
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,209
Yeah,

982
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,959
so the lowercase letters are 32

983
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:28,679
away

984
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,949
from the uppercase letters.

985
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,090
Well,

986
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:30,879
how do we know that?

987
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,090
Well,

988
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,010
97 minus 65 is,

989
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,169
yeah,

990
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,000
32.

991
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:37,169
98 minus 66 is OK,

992
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:37,719
32,

993
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:39,209
and that pattern continues.

994
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,090
What does this mean?

995
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:40,405
Well,

996
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:41,485
computers know how to do this.

997
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:43,475
Most normal humans don't need this information,

998
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:46,314
but what it means is if you are representing

999
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:47,514
in binary

1000
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:49,965
with your transistors on and off representing some pattern,

1001
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,024
and this is the pattern

1002
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:52,745
representing capital letter A,

1003
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,594
which is why we have a 1 in the 604 space and a 1

1004
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:56,955
in the ones place,

1005
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:01,514
how does a computer go about lower casing this same letter?

1006
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:02,475
Yeah.

1007
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:05,889
Perfect.

1008
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:11,320
All the computer has to do is change this one bit in the 32's place to a 1,

1009
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,610
because that has the effect mathematically per our discussion of adding

1010
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,840
the number 32 to whatever it is.

1011
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,489
So it turns out you can force text from upper case

1012
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:22,850
to lower case or back by just changing a single bit.

1013
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:24,739
Inside of that pattern

1014
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,790
of 8 bits in total.

1015
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,219
All right,

1016
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,729
why don't we maybe reinforce this with another quick exercise?

1017
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:32,419
We have an opportunity perhaps here for um maybe to give

1018
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:34,300
you some stress balls right at the very start of class.

1019
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:36,570
Could we get 8 volunteers to come up

1020
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,300
on stage,

1021
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,379
maybe over here

1022
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,370
and over here and over here on the left.

1023
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,899
Let me go all the way on the right.

1024
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:43,719
Uh,

1025
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,120
let's see.

1026
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,479
OK,

1027
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,760
the high hand here,

1028
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:45,979
the,

1029
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,030
the hand that's highest there,

1030
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,120
yes,

1031
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,310
we're making eye contact.

1032
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,629
How about all the way,

1033
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:49,929
what,

1034
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,120
wait,

1035
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:50,469
let's see,

1036
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,050
let's go here in the crimson

1037
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,030
sweatshirt here,

1038
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,850
and how about in the,

1039
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,709
the white shirt here?

1040
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,310
Come on up.

1041
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,010
Did I count correctly?

1042
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,570
Let's say

1043
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:00,889
Come on down.

1044
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,239
The 8 of you.

1045
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:02,530
I,

1046
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:03,370
I didn't count right,

1047
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:03,699
did I?

1048
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:06,520
123456.

1049
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:08,610
It's ironic that I'm not counting correctly here.

1050
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:10,070
How about on the left in gray?

1051
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:10,570
OK.

1052
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:10,800
Oh,

1053
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:12,000
OK,

1054
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,219
in black here.

1055
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:13,729
Come on down.

1056
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:13,969
All right,

1057
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:18,489
hopefully this is 81234567.

1058
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:20,149
7.

1059
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm pretty sure.

1060
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,989
OK,

1061
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,310
8,

1062
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:21,790
there we go.

1063
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:22,419
All right.

1064
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,909
So let's go ahead and do the following exercise.

1065
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,139
I've got some sheets of paper preprinted here.

1066
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:28,750
If each of you indeed want to do exactly what

1067
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,459
you're doing and line up from left to right,

1068
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:33,600
each of you is going to represent a placeholder essentially.

1069
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,419
So we have over here the ones place

1070
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:37,540
all the way over here,

1071
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,780
and then we have the choose place.

1072
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,810
And the 4th place

1073
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,229
and the eights.

1074
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,860
16

1075
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,610
32,

1076
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:47,870
64,

1077
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,840
128,

1078
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:50,639
and we come bearing a microphone.

1079
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,959
If each of you want to say a quick hello,

1080
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,469
your name,

1081
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,709
maybe your dorm or house,

1082
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,770
and something besides computer science that you're studying or want to.

1083
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,040
Hi,

1084
00:37:58,149 --> 00:37:58,439
I'm out.

1085
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,659
OK.

1086
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,659
I'm Alison.

1087
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,179
I'm a freshman in Mathews,

1088
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:04,270
and,

1089
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:05,219
um,

1090
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,770
I like climbing and I'm thinking of CS and Econ.

1091
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,719
2.

1092
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:10,360
Hi,

1093
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm Lily.

1094
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,169
I'm in Hurlbut this year and I'm thinking of doing CS in government.

1095
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,120
Nice to meet you.

1096
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,080
Hi,

1097
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,100
hi,

1098
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,709
I'm Sean.

1099
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,360
I'm in Candidate Hall and I'm thinking of doing astrophysics and CS.

1100
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:23,469
Welcome.

1101
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,199
Hi,

1102
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:24,939
I'm Jordan.

1103
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,010
I'm doing applied math with a specialization in CS and Econ,

1104
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:30,219
and,

1105
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:30,739
um,

1106
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,010
I'm in Widsworth,

1107
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:33,550
and I like going to the gym.

1108
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:35,929
16.

1109
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,169
Hi,

1110
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:36,719
I'm Shiv.

1111
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,209
I'm studying Mac and I'm in Canada.

1112
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:40,939
Nice.

1113
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:41,719
Hi,

1114
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,580
I'm Sophia.

1115
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:46,679
I'm in Thayer and I'm thinking of doing electrical engineering.

1116
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,449
Welcome.

1117
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:48,320
Hi,

1118
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,250
my name is Marie,

1119
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,360
and I'm in Canada B and I really like CS physics and astrophysics.

1120
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,899
Hi,

1121
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,139
I'm Alyssa.

1122
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,560
I'm in Holworthy.

1123
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,350
I'm also thinking of studying math or physics,

1124
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,179
and I also like to climb.

1125
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:03,879
Nice.

1126
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:04,850
Welcome to you all.

1127
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,300
So on the backs of their sheets of paper,

1128
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:09,379
they have a little cheat sheet that's describing what

1129
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:11,270
they should do in each of 3 rounds.

1130
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,750
We're going to spell out together a three letter word.

1131
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,399
You all as the audience have a cheat sheet above you that represents numbers,

1132
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,189
2 letters.

1133
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,389
These folks don't necessarily know what they're spelling.

1134
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,270
They only know what they individually are spelling.

1135
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:26,179
So if your sheet of paper tells you to represent a zero in a given round,

1136
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,469
just kind of stand there awkwardly,

1137
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,199
no hands up.

1138
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:31,290
But if you're told on your sheet of paper to represent a 1,

1139
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,350
just raise a single hand to make obvious to the

1140
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,199
audience that you're representing a 1 and not a zero.

1141
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,379
And the goal here is to figure out what we are spelling using this system called

1142
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,199
ASCI.

1143
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:40,669
All right,

1144
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,540
round 1,

1145
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:42,669
execute.

1146
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,419
What number is this here?

1147
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:50,820
I'm hearing

1148
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,280
you can just shout it out.

1149
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,989
What number?

1150
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,379
66 or B.

1151
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,360
So you're spelling

1152
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,080
B.

1153
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,399
All right,

1154
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,310
hands down.

1155
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,350
Round 2.

1156
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,260
More math.

1157
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,649
Feel free to shout it out

1158
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,060
Oh,

1159
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,389
I heard it,

1160
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:08,590
yeah,

1161
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:09,189
79,

1162
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:09,820
which is,

1163
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:10,620
oh,

1164
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:10,949
OK,

1165
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,719
so we have BO.

1166
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,419
Hands down,

1167
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,810
3rd and final round,

1168
00:40:15,189 --> 00:40:15,750
execute.

1169
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:17,469
Number

1170
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:21,649
Yes,

1171
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:22,219
87,

1172
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,189
which is the letter?

1173
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,169
W,

1174
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:25,250
which spells?

1175
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:26,620
Bow,

1176
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:28,199
if you want to take your bow now.

1177
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:29,510
Ah,

1178
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:29,929
OK,

1179
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,719
here we go.

1180
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,120
You guys can keep those.

1181
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:33,550
OK,

1182
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,110
thank you.

1183
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:35,590
All right,

1184
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:36,719
you guys see that back.

1185
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,580
Thank you to our volunteers here.

1186
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:39,889
Very nicely done.

1187
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,629
We indeed spelled out bow,

1188
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,280
and that's just because we all standardized on

1189
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,370
representing information in exactly the same way,

1190
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:49,840
which is why when you type BOW on your phone or your computer,

1191
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:52,090
the recipient sees the exact same thing.

1192
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,969
But what's noteworthy in this discussion is that you

1193
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,459
can't spell a huge number of words like,

1194
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:57,570
yeah,

1195
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,090
English,

1196
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:58,330
OK,

1197
00:40:58,409 --> 00:40:59,129
we've got that covered.

1198
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:00,822
But odds are you're noticing,

1199
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:05,132
depending on your own background what human languages you read or speak yourself,

1200
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:08,062
that a whole bunch of symbols might be missing from your keyboard.

1201
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:08,372
For instance,

1202
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,021
we have accented characters here in a lot of Asian languages.

1203
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,062
There's so many more glyphs than we could have even

1204
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:15,501
fit in that cheat sheet of numbers and letters.

1205
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:16,132
And so

1206
00:41:16,342 --> 00:41:19,142
ASCI is not the only system that the world uses.

1207
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:20,372
It was one of the earliest,

1208
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,862
but we've moved on in modern times to a super set of AI that's generally.

1209
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:26,503
Known as Unicode,

1210
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:30,833
and Unicode uses so many more bits than AI that we even have room

1211
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:34,354
for all of these little things that we seem to send constantly nowadays.

1212
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:38,224
These are obviously images that you might send with your phone or your computer,

1213
00:41:38,394 --> 00:41:40,634
but they're technically characters.

1214
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:43,793
They're technically just patterns of zeros and ones that have similarly

1215
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,503
been standardized around the world to look a certain way,

1216
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,674
but they're this is an emoji keyboard in the sense that.

1217
00:41:50,756 --> 00:41:51,716
You're sending

1218
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:52,726
characters.

1219
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:54,496
You're not sending images per se.

1220
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:56,246
The characters are displayed as images,

1221
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:56,966
obviously,

1222
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:59,885
but really these are just like characters in a different font,

1223
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:03,446
and that font happens to be very colorful and graphical as well.

1224
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:04,756
So Unicode,

1225
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:07,436
instead of using just 7 or 8 bits,

1226
00:42:07,686 --> 00:42:09,075
which if you do the quick mental math,

1227
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:12,285
if Asky only used 7 or let's say 8 bits,

1228
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:16,315
how many possible characters can you represent in Asky alone?

1229
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,530
256 because if we do that quick mental math,

1230
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:19,770
28,

1231
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,739
256 possibilities like that's it.

1232
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,129
That is,

1233
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,020
that's enough for English because you can cram all the uppercase letters,

1234
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,169
the lower case letters,

1235
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:26,929
the numbers,

1236
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:28,649
and a whole bunch of punctuation as well,

1237
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,419
but it's not enough for certain other punctuation symbols,

1238
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,580
not to mention many other human languages.

1239
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,260
And so the Unicode Consortium.

1240
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,459
Its charge in life has been to come up

1241
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:41,010
with a digital representation of all human language,

1242
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:41,570
past,

1243
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:42,290
present,

1244
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:48,209
and hopefully future by using not just 7 or 8 bits but maybe 16 bits per character,

1245
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:49,379
24 bits,

1246
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:49,780
or heck,

1247
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,860
even 32 bits per character.

1248
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:52,770
And per before,

1249
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,250
if you've got as many as 32 bits available to you,

1250
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,219
you can represent what,

1251
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,219
like 4 billion characters in total,

1252
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,860
and that's just one.

1253
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:01,409
One of the reasons why these emoji have

1254
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:04,199
kind of exploded in popularity and availability,

1255
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,530
there's just so many darn patterns like what else are we

1256
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,760
going to do with all of these zeros and ones.

1257
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,929
But more importantly,

1258
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:13,889
emoji have been designed to really represent people and places and

1259
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:17,439
things and emotions in a way that transcends human language.

1260
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:20,379
But even then they're somewhat open to interpretation.

1261
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:20,810
In fact,

1262
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:24,209
here's a pattern of I think 32 zeros and ones.

1263
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,810
Guessing no one's going to do the quick mental math here,

1264
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:30,260
but this represents what decimal number if we do in fact do out the

1265
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,050
math with that's being the ones place all the way over to the left,

1266
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:33,280
well,

1267
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,280
that's the number 4 billion,

1268
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:34,919
36,

1269
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,209
991,106.

1270
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,659
Who knows what that is?

1271
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:39,679
It's not a,

1272
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,620
and it's nothing near A upper case or lower case,

1273
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,169
but it is among the most popular emoji that you might send typically on your phone,

1274
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:47,939
laptop,

1275
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,699
or other device,

1276
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,260
namely.

1277
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,250
This thing here face

1278
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,780
with tears of joy,

1279
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,370
which odds are you've sent or received recently,

1280
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,429
but interestingly,

1281
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:59,239
even though many of you might have iPhones and see

1282
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,969
and send the same image,

1283
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,540
you'll notice that if you see a friend who's got Android or some other device,

1284
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:07,409
maybe you're using uh Meta's messenger program

1285
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:09,899
or Telegram or some other messaging service.

1286
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,345
Sometimes these emoji look a little bit different.

1287
00:44:12,456 --> 00:44:12,885
Why?

1288
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:16,805
Because what a Unicode has done is they decided there shall exist

1289
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:19,605
an emoji known as excuse me,

1290
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,565
faced with tears of joy.

1291
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:24,706
Then Apple and Google and Microsoft and others,

1292
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:27,226
they're sort of free to interpret that as they see fit.

1293
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,085
So what you see on the screen here is a recent version from iOS.

1294
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:31,441
operating system.

1295
00:44:31,691 --> 00:44:34,011
Google's version of the same looks a little something like this,

1296
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:36,322
and on Telegram if you have animations enabled,

1297
00:44:36,431 --> 00:44:40,132
the same idea faced with tears of joy is actually animated,

1298
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:43,761
but it's the same pattern of zeros and ones in each case,

1299
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:47,481
but again they each essentially have different graphical fonts to

1300
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:50,922
present to you what each of those images actually is.

1301
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:52,001
All right,

1302
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:53,362
so those are each,

1303
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,021
excuse me,

1304
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:54,931
images.

1305
00:44:58,219 --> 00:44:58,649
So

1306
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,330
those are each images.

1307
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,010
How is the computer representing them though?

1308
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:05,939
At the end of the day we've represented numbers,

1309
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,520
we've represented letters,

1310
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:07,969
but

1311
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:10,419
how about these things here colors.

1312
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,770
So how do we represent

1313
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,899
red or green or blue,

1314
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,939
not to mention every other color in between.

1315
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,560
At the end of the day,

1316
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,120
we only have one canvas at our disposal,

1317
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:20,530
yeah.

1318
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,530
So integers is the exact same answer as before.

1319
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,290
We just need to agree on what number do we use for red,

1320
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,409
what do we use for green,

1321
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,760
what do we use for blue,

1322
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,370
and we can come up with some standardized pattern for this.

1323
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:32,639
In fact,

1324
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:34,679
one of the most common techniques for doing this,

1325
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,250
and the one of the most common ways to do this in the real

1326
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,679
world is to use a combination of three colors together some amount of red,

1327
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:42,919
some amount of green,

1328
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,649
and some amount of blue and mix them together to get

1329
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:47,570
most any color of the rainbow that you might want.

1330
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,469
This is sort of a picture of something I grew up with back in the day where in

1331
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:56,139
like middle school when we'd watch movies or some kind of show and like in in class,

1332
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:58,979
we would kind of uh the projector screen would be over here.

1333
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:02,110
This is an old school projector with 3 different lenses,

1334
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:04,179
one of which projects some amount of green,

1335
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,110
some amount of red,

1336
00:46:05,189 --> 00:46:05,899
some amount of blue,

1337
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:06,870
and so long as the

1338
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,709
lenses are correctly oriented to all point at the

1339
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:12,939
same circle or like rectangular region on the screen,

1340
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:16,909
you would see any number of colors coming to life in the old school.

1341
00:46:16,995 --> 00:46:17,455
Video.

1342
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,735
I still remember all these years later we would kind of

1343
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:22,385
sit and lean up against it because it was super warm and you could

1344
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:24,745
feel it it's an easy way to fall asleep but back in grade school,

1345
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,145
but

1346
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:28,495
we use the same fundamental color system nowadays

1347
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:29,064
as well,

1348
00:46:29,304 --> 00:46:31,215
including in modern programs like Photoshop.

1349
00:46:31,304 --> 00:46:32,655
So let's abstract that away,

1350
00:46:32,945 --> 00:46:35,455
focus on just three colors some amount of red,

1351
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:36,064
green,

1352
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:36,774
and blue,

1353
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:38,935
and let's propose for the sake of discussion

1354
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:42,004
that we want to mix together like a medium amount of red,

1355
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:43,304
a medium amount of green,

1356
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,014
and just a little bit of blue.

1357
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:45,935
For instance,

1358
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,729
Let's propose

1359
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,489
that we'll use 72 amount of red,

1360
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,219
23 amount of green,

1361
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,989
or 33 amount of blue RGB.

1362
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,209
Now why these numbers?

1363
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:58,379
Well,

1364
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,899
in the context of ASCI or Unicode,

1365
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,570
which is just a superset thereof,

1366
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,010
what is this spell?

1367
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:05,300
Hi,

1368
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:05,860
but again,

1369
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,620
if you were instead to open a file containing

1370
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,050
these 3 numbers or really these 3 bytes of bits

1371
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,389
in Photoshop,

1372
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,330
you would hope that they're going to be interpreted not as letters on the screen,

1373
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,580
but as some the color of a dot on the screen instead.

1374
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:25,729
So it turns out that in typically

1375
00:47:25,939 --> 00:47:27,889
when you have three of these numbers together,

1376
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,020
each of them is using a single byte,

1377
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,300
so 8 bits.

1378
00:47:31,419 --> 00:47:34,550
So you can have 0 red or 255 red,

1379
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,060
0 green or 255 green or 0 to 255 of blue.

1380
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,354
So 0 is none,

1381
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,554
255 is the max.

1382
00:47:42,804 --> 00:47:44,235
So if we mix these together,

1383
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:46,465
imagine just like that projector

1384
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,715
consolidating these three colors into one central point.

1385
00:47:50,395 --> 00:47:52,645
Anyone want to guess what you're gonna get if you mix some red,

1386
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:53,044
some green,

1387
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,405
some blue in those amounts and way back?

1388
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,310
Yeah,

1389
00:47:58,389 --> 00:47:59,949
you're going to get a dark shade of yellow.

1390
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:01,790
I've brightened it up a little bit for the projector here,

1391
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,350
but you're going to get it roughly this shade of yellow,

1392
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,989
and we could play with these numbers all day long and get

1393
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:10,340
similar results if we want to represent different colors as well.

1394
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:10,909
And indeed,

1395
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:12,979
whether it's Photoshop or some other program,

1396
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,629
you can actually combine these amounts in all

1397
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:17,229
sorts of ratios to get different colors.

1398
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,219
So if you had 000,

1399
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:20,070
so no red,

1400
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:20,550
no green,

1401
00:48:20,629 --> 00:48:21,110
no blue,

1402
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,560
take a guess as to what color that's going to be in the computer.

1403
00:48:24,189 --> 00:48:24,989
So it's gonna be black,

1404
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,649
like the absence of all three of those colors,

1405
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:31,350
but if you mix the maximal amount of each of those 255 red and green and blue,

1406
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:32,949
that's gonna give you white.

1407
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,949
Now if any of you have made web pages before or use programs like Photoshop,

1408
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,409
you might have seen numbers like 00.

1409
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:40,780
Or FF.

1410
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:41,860
Long story short,

1411
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:47,209
that's just another base system for representing numbers between 0 and 255 as well,

1412
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,850
but we'll come back to that mint semester when we make some of our own

1413
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,850
filters,

1414
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,010
uh,

1415
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,629
in sort of an Instagram-like way manipulating images of our own.

1416
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,419
So where are these colors coming from or where can we actually see them?

1417
00:48:58,459 --> 00:48:58,580
Well,

1418
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,489
here's just a picture of that same emoji faced with tears of joy.

1419
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:04,610
If I kind of zoom in on that and maybe zoom in again,

1420
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,260
you can start to see if you blow it up enough or

1421
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,770
if you put your eyes close enough to the device sometimes,

1422
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:13,020
you can actually see individual dots or squares.

1423
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:15,620
These are generally known as pixels,

1424
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:19,520
and they're just the individual dots that collectively compose in

1425
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:22,477
which is to say that if each of these dots,

1426
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:23,707
which is part of the image,

1427
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:26,556
is going to be a distinct color like this one's yellow,

1428
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:27,477
this one's brown,

1429
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:29,066
and then there's a bunch in between,

1430
00:49:29,356 --> 00:49:29,707
well,

1431
00:49:29,757 --> 00:49:35,076
you're using some number of bits to represent each of those pixels' colors.

1432
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:37,707
So if you imagine using the RGB system,

1433
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:40,356
that's 8 + 8 + 8 bits,

1434
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:42,076
so that's 24 bits

1435
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,826
or 3 bytes,

1436
00:49:43,836 --> 00:49:44,007
just.

1437
00:49:44,063 --> 00:49:48,364
To keep track of the color of each and every one of these dots.

1438
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:51,013
So now if you think about having downloaded a GIF at some point,

1439
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:52,043
a ping,

1440
00:49:52,134 --> 00:49:53,233
PNG file,

1441
00:49:53,813 --> 00:49:54,444
a JPEG,

1442
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:55,553
or any other file format,

1443
00:49:55,733 --> 00:49:57,854
it's usually measured in what file size like

1444
00:49:57,854 --> 00:50:00,773
megabytes typically that means millions of bytes.

1445
00:50:00,813 --> 00:50:01,283
Why?

1446
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:04,444
Because if it's a pretty big photograph or pretty big image,

1447
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:07,924
each of those dots takes up at least 3 bytes,

1448
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:08,454
it would seem.

1449
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,631
And if you do out the math,

1450
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,950
if you've got thousands of dots,

1451
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:12,631
each of which uses 3 bytes,

1452
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,710
you're going to quickly get to megabytes,

1453
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,710
if not even larger,

1454
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,460
for things like,

1455
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:16,940
say,

1456
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:17,621
videos.

1457
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,990
But again,

1458
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:21,950
it's just patterns of zeros and ones and so long as the programmer knows what

1459
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,470
they're doing and tells the computer how to

1460
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,631
interpret those zeros and ones and equivalently,

1461
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,391
so long as the software knows,

1462
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:33,131
look at these zeros and ones and interpret them as numbers or letters or colors,

1463
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,260
we should see what we intended to represent.

1464
00:50:36,919 --> 00:50:37,080
All right,

1465
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,760
so that's num that's uh colors and images.

1466
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:42,199
What about how many of you kind of played with

1467
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:44,080
these little flip books as a kid where they've got like

1468
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,949
100 different little pictures and you flip through them really quickly

1469
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:49,629
and you see what looks like animation in book form?

1470
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:50,080
Well,

1471
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:51,949
this is essentially a video,

1472
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,679
so therefore what is a video or how can you think of what a video is?

1473
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,989
It's just a whole bunch of like images

1474
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:00,510
flying across the screen either on paper or digitally

1475
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,629
nowadays on your phone or your laptop and

1476
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:04,699
that's kind of nice because we're sort of composing

1477
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:07,750
more interesting media now based on these lower level

1478
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,540
building blocks and this is going to be thematic.

1479
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:11,500
We literally started with zeros and ones.

1480
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,429
we worked our way up to letters.

1481
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,139
We then worked our way up to sort of images and colors and thus images.

1482
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:21,469
Now we're up at this level of hierarchy in terms of video because what's a video.

1483
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:25,574
It's like 30 images per second flying across

1484
00:51:25,574 --> 00:51:28,014
the screen or maybe slightly fewer than that,

1485
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:32,304
that collectively tricks our mind into thinking we are seeing motion pictures,

1486
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,044
and that's the old school term for movies,

1487
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:35,695
but it literally is what it was.

1488
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:40,294
Motion pictures was this film was showing you 30 pictures per second,

1489
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:41,534
and it looks like motion,

1490
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:43,254
even though you're just looking at images,

1491
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:46,705
much like this flip book very quickly one after the other.

1492
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:48,080
What about music?

1493
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,340
Well,

1494
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:51,770
how could you go about representing musical notes if again

1495
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,379
your only ingredients are zeros and ones.

1496
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,449
Even if you're not a musician,

1497
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,780
how do you represent music like that on the screen here?

1498
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,060
Yeah.

1499
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,550
OK,

1500
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:02,350
so the frequency,

1501
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:04,219
like the tone that you're actually hearing

1502
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:05,100
from the device,

1503
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:08,399
what else might weigh in beside besides the frequency of the notes?

1504
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:09,219
Yeah.

1505
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,000
So the speed of the note,

1506
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,860
maybe the duration,

1507
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,600
like if you think about a physical piano,

1508
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:16,149
like how long you're holding the key down for or not,

1509
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,750
what else?

1510
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,100
So the amplitude may be how loud,

1511
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:22,149
like how hard did you hit the keyboard to generate that sound.

1512
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:24,699
So let me propose at the risk of simplifying,

1513
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,780
we could represent each of these notes using 3 numbers,

1514
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:31,070
maybe 0 to 255 or some other range that

1515
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,949
represents the frequency or the pitch of the note.

1516
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:38,830
Duration and the loudness and so long as the person receiving a file containing all

1517
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:42,580
of those zeros and ones knows how to interpret them three at a time,

1518
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,939
I bet you could share

1519
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:48,860
a musical file with someone else that they could hear in exactly the same way

1520
00:52:49,189 --> 00:52:51,439
that you yourself intended.

1521
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,020
Let me pause here

1522
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,120
to see

1523
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,870
if there's any questions now because we've already built

1524
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,889
our way up from zeros and ones now to

1525
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,939
video

1526
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:01,060
and sound.

1527
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:02,050
Yeah,

1528
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:02,679
in front.

1529
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,790
What the letter like 65 would be and then the number 5.

1530
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,409
So how does the computer distinguish between the letter 65 and the number 65?

1531
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:15,739
It's context dependent.

1532
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,110
So

1533
00:53:16,379 --> 00:53:16,860
put simply,

1534
00:53:16,899 --> 00:53:18,590
and we'll see this as early as next week,

1535
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:20,810
the programmer tells the computer

1536
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,250
how to display the information either as a number or a letter

1537
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,939
or equivalently once.

1538
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:26,794
Programmed,

1539
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:32,354
the software knows that when it opens a dot GIF file or jpayEG or

1540
00:53:32,354 --> 00:53:36,925
something else to interpret those zeros and ones as colors instead of as like.

1541
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:39,665
DOCX for Microsoft Word file

1542
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:40,665
or the like.

1543
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:41,625
Other questions.

1544
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,479
On any of these representations,

1545
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,050
yeah,

1546
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,189
in front like the 1 thing like really briefly.

1547
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:50,419
Sure,

1548
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,399
so can we go on base 10 and base 2?

1549
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:55,790
So base 10 is like literally the numbers you and I use every day.

1550
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,479
It's base 10 in the sense that you have 10 digits at your disposal,

1551
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,610
0 through 9,

1552
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,719
and any numbers you want to represent in the

1553
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,790
real world must be composed using 0 through 9.

1554
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:09,270
The binary system or base 2 is fundamentally the same.

1555
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:09,959
It's just the.

1556
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:11,686
doesn't have access to 2

1557
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:12,656
through 9.

1558
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,545
It only has access to 0 and 1.

1559
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:17,325
But much like the light bulbs I was displaying here,

1560
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:20,166
you can simply ascribe different weights

1561
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:24,575
to each of the digits so that instead of it being as much as the one's place,

1562
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:25,176
the tens place,

1563
00:54:25,216 --> 00:54:25,895
and the hundreds place,

1564
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:27,895
if we more modestly say the one's place,

1565
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:28,696
the two's place,

1566
00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:29,645
the four's place,

1567
00:54:29,696 --> 00:54:29,976
we can.

1568
00:54:30,082 --> 00:54:31,162
The same system

1569
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:35,191
in binary you might need to use more digits to count

1570
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:39,001
as high because in 255 you can just write 255.

1571
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,662
That's 3 digits in decimal.

1572
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:44,511
But in binary we've seen you need to use 8 such digits,

1573
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:45,422
which is more,

1574
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:47,302
but it's still much better than unary,

1575
00:54:47,312 --> 00:54:49,991
which would have had 255 light bulbs on.

1576
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,399
Instead.

1577
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,669
And they like.

1578
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,219
Is binary and base 2 the same thing?

1579
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:58,919
Yes,

1580
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,760
just like base 10 and decimal are the same thing as well,

1581
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,379
and unary and base 1

1582
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:05,219
are the same thing as well.

1583
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,020
All right,

1584
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:08,489
so let me just stipulate that even though we sort of

1585
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:09,989
took this tour quickly at the end of the day,

1586
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:12,080
computers only have zeros and ones at their disposal.

1587
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:12,550
So again,

1588
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:15,550
the answer to any question is to how can we represent.

1589
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:20,239
X is going to somehow involve permuting those zeros and ones

1590
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:23,830
into patterns or equivalently into the numbers that they represent.

1591
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,949
But if we now have a way to represent all inputs in the world,

1592
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,760
be it letters,

1593
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:28,280
numbers,

1594
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:28,760
images,

1595
00:55:28,879 --> 00:55:29,199
videos,

1596
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:29,949
anything else,

1597
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,989
and get output from some problem solving process,

1598
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,800
like how do we actually solve problems?

1599
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:34,919
Well,

1600
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:36,830
the secret sauce in the middle here is another term

1601
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,840
that you've probably heard in the real world nowadays,

1602
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:40,360
which is that of algorithm.

1603
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:43,867
step by step instructions for solving some problem.

1604
00:55:44,097 --> 00:55:47,347
So this ultimately is what computer science really is about too.

1605
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:50,478
It's not just representing information but somehow processing it,

1606
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,077
doing something interesting with it to actually solve the problem that you've

1607
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:57,347
been provided as input so you can output the correct answer.

1608
00:55:57,597 --> 00:56:00,318
Now there's all sorts of algorithms implemented in

1609
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:02,387
our phones and in our Macs and PCs,

1610
00:56:02,397 --> 00:56:03,548
and that's all software is.

1611
00:56:03,718 --> 00:56:04,958
It's an implementation in.

1612
00:56:05,045 --> 00:56:05,946
Code,

1613
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:09,305
be it C++ or Java or anything else,

1614
00:56:09,476 --> 00:56:10,946
other languages exist too

1615
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:11,746
in

1616
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:13,916
code that the computer understands,

1617
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:15,686
but it's still just step by step instructions.

1618
00:56:15,795 --> 00:56:19,196
And among the things we'll learn in CS 50 is how to express yourself in different

1619
00:56:19,196 --> 00:56:21,635
ways to solve problems not only in different

1620
00:56:21,635 --> 00:56:24,266
languages but using different methodologies as well,

1621
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:25,016
because as we'll see,

1622
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:27,516
among the reasons we introduced these several languages is

1623
00:56:27,516 --> 00:56:29,516
you don't just learn more and more languages.

1624
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:31,934
They allow you to solve the same problems.

1625
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:35,474
Different languages will allow you to solve different problems and even

1626
00:56:35,474 --> 00:56:38,583
save you time by being better tools for the job.

1627
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:39,333
So here,

1628
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:39,773
for instance,

1629
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:42,553
on an iPhone is maybe a bunch of contacts,

1630
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:45,354
which is presumably familiar where we might have a whole bunch of

1631
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:48,833
friends and family and whatnot alphabetized by first name or last name.

1632
00:56:48,914 --> 00:56:51,434
And suppose we want to find one such person like John Harvard,

1633
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,073
whose number here might be + 1 94946.

1634
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:55,362
82,750.

1635
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:57,251
Feel free to call or text him sometime.

1636
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,912
This is the goal of this problem.

1637
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:02,832
If we have our contacts app and I start typing

1638
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:05,021
in John's name by first name or last name,

1639
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:09,711
the autocomplete nowadays kicks in and it somehow filters the list down from my 10

1640
00:57:09,711 --> 00:57:15,102
or 100 friends or 1000 friends into just the single directory entry that matches.

1641
00:57:15,312 --> 00:57:15,981
So here too,

1642
00:57:16,112 --> 00:57:18,072
back in the days of RG&B.

1643
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,250
Projectors we had phone books like this here too.

1644
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:24,459
I'm pleased to say thanks to our friend Alexis,

1645
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,010
this is the largest phone book that we've used for this demonstration.

1646
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,979
This is an old school phone book that's essentially the

1647
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,500
same thing as our contacts app or address book nowadays,

1648
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,989
whereby I've got a whole bunch

1649
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,780
of names and numbers alphabetically sorted by first name or last name,

1650
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,330
whatever,

1651
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,419
and corresponding to each of those as a number.

1652
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,340
So back in the day,

1653
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:43,260
and frankly even nowadays in your phone.

1654
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:47,834
How do you go about finding someone in a phone book or your contacts app?

1655
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:48,044
Well,

1656
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,155
you could very naively just start at the beginning

1657
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:55,635
and look down and just turn one page at a time looking for John Harvard in this case.

1658
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:56,014
Now,

1659
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:57,205
so long as I'm paying attention,

1660
00:57:57,284 --> 00:57:58,754
this step by step process

1661
00:57:59,304 --> 00:58:01,135
will get me to John Harvard.

1662
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,274
Like this is a correct algorithm,

1663
00:58:03,604 --> 00:58:06,794
even though you might kind of object to how I'm doing this,

1664
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:07,594
why,

1665
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,834
what's bad about this algorithm?

1666
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,419
It's just slow.

1667
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:12,459
I mean this is crazy slow.

1668
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,290
If there's like 1000 pages in the songbook,

1669
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,300
which looks like there are like this could take me as

1670
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,629
many as 1000 pages or maybe he's roughly in the middle,

1671
00:58:18,689 --> 00:58:20,050
it's like 500 pages.

1672
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:20,649
Like that's crazy.

1673
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,489
That's really rather slow,

1674
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:24,250
especially if I'm going to do this again and again.

1675
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:24,500
Well,

1676
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,540
what if I do it a little smarter grade school,

1677
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,879
I sort of learned how to count 2 at a time,

1678
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:30,129
so 2468,

1679
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,489
1012,

1680
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,639
1416,

1681
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:33,270
18.

1682
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:33,500
Again,

1683
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,659
if I'm paying attention,

1684
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,969
I'll get there twice as fast because I'm counting 2 at a time,

1685
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,149
but is that algorithm step by step correct?

1686
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:42,320
And I'm seeing no,

1687
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:43,080
but why?

1688
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,399
I might skip over John Harvard.

1689
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,330
So just by bad luck and kind of with 50/50 probability,

1690
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,120
he's going to be sandwiched between two of the pages.

1691
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:54,389
Now I don't have to abort this algorithm altogether.

1692
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,189
I could just,

1693
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,389
as soon as I get past the J section if we're doing it by first name,

1694
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,530
I could just double back one page and just make sure that I haven't missed him.

1695
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,280
So it's recoverable and this algorithm therefore is sort of twice as fast.

1696
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:07,159
Mm,

1697
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:09,159
plus one extra step maybe to double back,

1698
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:11,560
but that's arguably otherwise a bug or a mistake

1699
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,830
in the algorithm if I don't fix it intelligently.

1700
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,520
But what did we do back in the day and what does your iPhone or Android phone do?

1701
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,110
What they typically do is they go roughly to the middle,

1702
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,429
look physically or virtually down,

1703
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:22,919
they see,

1704
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,159
oh,

1705
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,790
I'm in the M section,

1706
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:26,370
and so which side is John Harber to,

1707
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:27,800
to the left or to the right?

1708
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:29,479
So he's to the left,

1709
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,760
so I could literally now.

1710
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,169
Jesus Christ.

1711
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,729
We talked about this before class and this might be more,

1712
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,699
oh my God.

1713
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:42,129
There we go.

1714
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,100
We can tear the problem in half.

1715
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:44,770
Thank you.

1716
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,449
It's been a while.

1717
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:50,699
Uh,

1718
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:52,060
we can tear the problem in half.

1719
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:53,899
We know that John Harvard is to the left,

1720
00:59:53,939 --> 00:59:54,969
so I can throw

1721
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,669
half of the problem away if,

1722
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:57,929
uh,

1723
00:59:57,939 --> 00:59:58,500
dramatically,

1724
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,969
such that I'm now going to from a 1000 page problem

1725
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,209
to 500 pages instead.

1726
01:00:03,419 --> 01:00:04,139
What now can I do?

1727
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:06,979
I can go roughly to the middle here and maybe I'm in the E section.

1728
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,810
So I went a little too far back to the left,

1729
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,689
but I kept it simple and I just divided

1730
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,219
so that I can conquer this problem,

1731
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:12,739
if you will.

1732
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,020
And if I'm in the E section now,

1733
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,770
is John Harvard to the left or to the right?

1734
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,699
To the right,

1735
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,570
so I can get,

1736
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:18,510
Jesus.

1737
01:00:21,959 --> 01:00:23,669
Tear the problem in half,

1738
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:24,760
and now,

1739
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,389
thank you.

1740
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:28,540
So now John Harvard again is going to be in this half.

1741
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,639
I can throw this half away.

1742
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,260
So now I've gone from 1000 to 500 to 250,

1743
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:32,969
and I can repeat,

1744
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,310
repeat,

1745
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:33,739
repeat,

1746
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,030
down to 125,

1747
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:35,469
half of that,

1748
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:35,870
half of that,

1749
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:36,510
half of that,

1750
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,189
so I'm left with finally

1751
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:39,560
just a single page.

1752
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,939
And John Harvard is hopefully now on this page such that I can call him

1753
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,909
or not at all,

1754
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:44,590
at which point this is.

1755
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:45,899
All sort of for naught,

1756
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:50,070
but what's powerful about each of those algorithms is that the sort of good,

1757
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:50,520
better,

1758
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,270
and best.

1759
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,889
Like they all get the job done,

1760
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:55,739
conditional on the second one having that little fix just to

1761
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:58,310
make sure I don't miss John Harber between two pages,

1762
01:00:58,419 --> 01:01:01,689
but they're fundamentally different in their efficiency

1763
01:01:01,689 --> 01:01:03,219
and the quality of their design.

1764
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:06,929
And this is really representative of one of the emphases of a class like this.

1765
01:01:06,979 --> 01:01:10,129
It's not just about writing correct code or getting the job done,

1766
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,030
but doing it well and doing it quickly,

1767
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:16,810
using the least amount of CPU or computing resources,

1768
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,350
using the minimal amount of RAM,

1769
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:20,199
using the fewest number of people

1770
01:01:20,379 --> 01:01:21,729
using the least amount of money,

1771
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,080
whatever your constrained resource is,

1772
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:25,810
solving a problem better.

1773
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:27,340
So that first algorithm,

1774
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,889
step by step instructions,

1775
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,760
was all about doing something

1776
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,659
like this whereby.

1777
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:33,860
The first algorithm,

1778
01:01:33,919 --> 01:01:36,070
if we plot things on a grid like this,

1779
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,379
we have on the x axis a representation of the size of the problem.

1780
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,159
So this would mean small problem like 0 pages.

1781
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,669
This would mean big problem like 1000 pages,

1782
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,919
and then the Y or vertical axis we have some measurement of time.

1783
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:51,770
So this is the number of seconds or the number of page turns,

1784
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,360
whatever you're.

1785
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:53,885
Metric actually is,

1786
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,254
so this would be not much time at all,

1787
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,254
so fast this would be a lot of time,

1788
01:01:58,415 --> 01:01:59,044
so slow.

1789
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,854
So what's the relationship if we just roughly draw these three algorithms?

1790
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:02,985
Well,

1791
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:04,804
the first one is technically a straight line,

1792
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:06,324
and we'll describe that as n.

1793
01:02:06,415 --> 01:02:10,314
The slope is N because if you think of N as a number for the number of pages,

1794
01:02:10,495 --> 01:02:10,564
well,

1795
01:02:10,574 --> 01:02:11,975
there's a 1 to 1 relationship.

1796
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:16,100
And the first algorithm as to how many times I have to turn the page

1797
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,330
based on how many pages there actually is,

1798
01:02:18,379 --> 01:02:19,969
and you can think about this in the extreme.

1799
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,570
If I was looking for someone whose name started with Z,

1800
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,620
I might have to go through like 1000 darn pages

1801
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,070
to get to that person whose name started with Z

1802
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,209
unless again I do something hackish and just kind of cheat and go to the end.

1803
01:02:31,379 --> 01:02:34,209
If we execute these algorithms again and again in the same way,

1804
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,649
that's going to be pretty slow.

1805
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,300
But the second algorithm was.

1806
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:40,697
Pretty much twice as fast plus that one extra step potentially,

1807
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:43,937
but it's still a straight line because if there's 1000 pages

1808
01:02:44,187 --> 01:02:47,298
and I'm dividing the problem and doing two pages at a time,

1809
01:02:47,508 --> 01:02:47,568
well,

1810
01:02:47,587 --> 01:02:49,907
that's like N divided by 2 steps plus 1,

1811
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:50,738
give or take.

1812
01:02:50,907 --> 01:02:52,937
But it's still a straight line because,

1813
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,137
but it's still better.

1814
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:56,458
Notice if this is the size of the problem,

1815
01:02:56,508 --> 01:02:58,218
1000 pages for instance,

1816
01:02:58,387 --> 01:03:02,468
we'll notice that the first algorithm took literally twice as much time.

1817
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:03,795
As the second algorithm,

1818
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,266
so we're doing better already,

1819
01:03:05,436 --> 01:03:07,466
but the third algorithm fundamentally

1820
01:03:07,835 --> 01:03:09,135
is going to look something like this.

1821
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:10,645
And if you remember your logarithms,

1822
01:03:10,795 --> 01:03:11,305
so to speak,

1823
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:13,065
sort of the opposite of an exponential,

1824
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:14,285
this curve

1825
01:03:14,516 --> 01:03:15,466
is so much

1826
01:03:15,756 --> 01:03:17,115
lower and flatter,

1827
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:17,825
if you will,

1828
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:19,035
than either of these two.

1829
01:03:19,156 --> 01:03:19,746
Mathematically,

1830
01:03:19,756 --> 01:03:20,785
more on this another time,

1831
01:03:20,936 --> 01:03:25,426
the slope is going to be like log based 2 of N or just logarithmic in nature,

1832
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:27,555
but what it means is that it's growing very.

1833
01:03:27,694 --> 01:03:28,003
Very,

1834
01:03:28,043 --> 01:03:28,333
very,

1835
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:29,674
very slowly.

1836
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:30,364
It's still going up.

1837
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:32,993
It's never going to flat line and go perfectly horizontal,

1838
01:03:33,124 --> 01:03:34,444
but it goes up very slowly.

1839
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:34,954
Why?

1840
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:35,164
Well,

1841
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:38,114
if you think about two towns nearby like Cambridge on this side

1842
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,313
of the river and the town of Alston on the other,

1843
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:43,313
suppose that they still have phone books like this one and they merge

1844
01:03:43,563 --> 01:03:45,114
their phone books for whatever reason.

1845
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:49,483
So overnight we go from a 1000 page phone book to a 2000 page phone book.

1846
01:03:49,684 --> 01:03:52,513
The first algorithm is going to take literally twice as long.

1847
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:56,642
As well the second one because we're only going through it 1 or 2 pages at a time,

1848
01:03:56,822 --> 01:03:58,612
but if the phone book size doubles

1849
01:03:59,052 --> 01:03:59,842
from this year,

1850
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:00,471
for instance,

1851
01:04:00,531 --> 01:04:01,402
to next year,

1852
01:04:01,652 --> 01:04:04,362
you can kind of in your mind's eye think about the green line.

1853
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:05,521
It's not going to go up

1854
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:07,322
that much higher.

1855
01:04:07,612 --> 01:04:08,082
Why?

1856
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:08,372
Well,

1857
01:04:08,451 --> 01:04:09,362
practically speaking,

1858
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:13,041
even if the phone book becomes 2000 pages long,

1859
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:13,491
well,

1860
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:17,711
how many more times do you have to tear or divide that problem in half?

1861
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:23,489
Just one because you're taking a 1000 page bye out of it or a 500 then a 250,

1862
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:27,959
you're taking much bigger bytes out of it than just one or two at a time.

1863
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:31,090
And so what computer science and what algorithms and about

1864
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:34,459
good design is about is figuring out what is the logic

1865
01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:39,679
via which you can solve problems not only correctly but efficiently as well.

1866
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:42,370
And that then gives us these things called algorithms.

1867
01:04:42,399 --> 01:04:43,560
And when it comes time to code,

1868
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:44,729
which we're about to do too.

1869
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,850
Code is just an implementation and a language the computer understands

1870
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:50,100
of an algorithm.

1871
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,850
Now this assumes that we've come up with some digital way,

1872
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:56,649
that is to say 0 and 1 based way to represent names

1873
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,530
and numbers,

1874
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,750
but honestly we already did that.

1875
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,100
We came up with the ASCI and then Unicode to represent the names,

1876
01:05:02,179 --> 01:05:04,260
and representing numbers is even easier than that.

1877
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,770
That's really where we started.

1878
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,820
So code is just about taking it.

1879
01:05:07,972 --> 01:05:11,643
Input some standardized representation of names and numbers and spitting out

1880
01:05:11,643 --> 01:05:15,113
answers and that's truly what iOS and Android are doing.

1881
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:16,913
When you start doing autocomplete,

1882
01:05:17,232 --> 01:05:20,272
they could be searching from the top to the bottom,

1883
01:05:20,443 --> 01:05:23,472
which is fine if you've only got a few friends and family in the phone.

1884
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:27,893
But if you've got 1000 or if you've got 10,000 or if it's not a phone book anymore,

1885
01:05:27,962 --> 01:05:30,232
it's some database with lots and lots of data.

1886
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:30,722
Well it's.

1887
01:05:30,986 --> 01:05:34,186
to reason that it'd be nice maybe if the computer kept it

1888
01:05:34,186 --> 01:05:37,615
all alphabetized just like that book and jumped to the middle,

1889
01:05:37,865 --> 01:05:38,865
then the middle of the middle,

1890
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:41,016
then the middle of the middle of the middle and so forth.

1891
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:41,496
Why?

1892
01:05:41,906 --> 01:05:44,656
Because the speed is going to be much,

1893
01:05:44,706 --> 01:05:45,295
much faster,

1894
01:05:45,466 --> 01:05:47,976
logarithmic in nature and not linear,

1895
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:48,545
so to speak,

1896
01:05:48,555 --> 01:05:48,976
in nature,

1897
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:50,855
but we'll revisit those topics as well.

1898
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:51,775
But for now,

1899
01:05:52,065 --> 01:05:53,656
before we get into actual code.

1900
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:55,469
Let's talk for a moment about

1901
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,510
pseudo code.

1902
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,439
So pseudo code is not one formal thing,

1903
01:05:58,629 --> 01:06:02,060
but every human will come up with their own way of representing pseudo code.

1904
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:05,169
It's an English-like or human-like formulation of

1905
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,739
step by step instructions just using terse

1906
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:08,699
correct

1907
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,620
English or whatever human language.

1908
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:11,540
So for instance,

1909
01:06:11,629 --> 01:06:14,379
if I want to translate what I did somewhat intuitively

1910
01:06:14,379 --> 01:06:16,189
with that phone book by just dividing in half,

1911
01:06:16,229 --> 01:06:18,320
dividing in half into step by step instructions,

1912
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:18,870
I could hand.

1913
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:22,155
Or nowadays like a robot or something like that.

1914
01:06:22,324 --> 01:06:22,405
Well,

1915
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:24,245
step one was essentially to pick up the phone book,

1916
01:06:24,364 --> 01:06:25,074
which I did.

1917
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:29,465
Step 2 was I opened to the middle of the phone book in the third and final algorithm.

1918
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,995
Step 3 was look at the page as I did.

1919
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:35,364
Step 4 got a little more interesting even though I didn't verbalize this.

1920
01:06:35,514 --> 01:06:37,554
Presumably I was asking myself a question.

1921
01:06:37,804 --> 01:06:39,054
If the person I'm looking for,

1922
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:39,725
John Harvard,

1923
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:40,875
is on the page,

1924
01:06:41,324 --> 01:06:41,975
then

1925
01:06:42,324 --> 01:06:43,844
I would have called him right then.

1926
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,120
But if you weren't on the page,

1927
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,260
if you instead were earlier in the book,

1928
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:49,409
as did happen,

1929
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,090
well then I'm going to go to the left,

1930
01:06:51,169 --> 01:06:51,719
so to speak,

1931
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:53,050
but more methodically,

1932
01:06:53,169 --> 01:06:55,840
I'm going to open to the middle of the left half of the book.

1933
01:06:56,129 --> 01:06:57,840
Then I'm going to go back to

1934
01:06:58,449 --> 01:06:59,600
line 3.

1935
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:00,290
That's interesting.

1936
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,439
We'll come back to that in a moment,

1937
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,600
but else if the person is later in the book,

1938
01:07:03,689 --> 01:07:03,729
well,

1939
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,540
I'm going to open to the middle of the right half of the book

1940
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,520
and then go back

1941
01:07:08,729 --> 01:07:09,939
to line 3.

1942
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:10,469
Now,

1943
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:11,429
let's pause here.

1944
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,199
Why do I keep going back to line 3?

1945
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,510
This would seem to get me doing the same thing

1946
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:16,949
forever,

1947
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,080
endlessly.

1948
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,120
But not quite.

1949
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:23,770
Why?

1950
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:24,870
Yeah,

1951
01:07:24,989 --> 01:07:28,550
so because I am dividing the problem in half,

1952
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:29,189
for instance,

1953
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:33,100
on line 6 or line 9 implicitly just based on how I've written this,

1954
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,560
the problem's getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

1955
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,909
So it's fine if I keep doing the same logic

1956
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:39,800
again and again because if the problem's getting smaller.

1957
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,439
Eventually it's going to bottom out and I'm gonna have just

1958
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:46,760
one person on that page that I want to call and so the algorithm's done.

1959
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:48,959
But there is a perverse corner case,

1960
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:49,399
if you will,

1961
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:51,770
and this is where it's ever more important to be

1962
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:55,350
precise when writing code and anticipate what could go wrong.

1963
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,679
I should probably ask one more question in this code,

1964
01:07:58,770 --> 01:07:59,889
not just these three.

1965
01:08:00,879 --> 01:08:01,760
What might that

1966
01:08:01,979 --> 01:08:02,639
question.

1967
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,320
Yeah.

1968
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:07,790
Yeah,

1969
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:09,739
so if John Harvard is not in the book,

1970
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:13,070
there's this corner case where what if I'm just wasting my time entirely and

1971
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,179
I get to the end of the phone book and John Harvard's not there,

1972
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,580
what should the computer do?

1973
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:16,790
Well,

1974
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:17,350
as an aside,

1975
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:20,750
if you've ever been using your Mac or PC or phone and the thing just freezes

1976
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,390
or like the stupid little beach ball starts

1977
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,819
spinning or something like that and you're like,

1978
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:24,830
what is going on?

1979
01:08:25,149 --> 01:08:29,339
Some human at Google or Microsoft or Apple or the like made a mistake.

1980
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:30,140
They forgot,

1981
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:30,700
for instance,

1982
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:33,669
that 4th uncommon but possible.

1983
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,844
Situation wherein if they don't tell the computer how to handle it,

1984
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:39,724
the computer's effectively going to freak out and do something

1985
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:43,733
undefined like just hang or reboot or do something else.

1986
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:45,283
So we do want to add this else

1987
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:47,663
quit altogether.

1988
01:08:47,764 --> 01:08:50,934
So you have well defined behavior and truly think that the next time

1989
01:08:50,934 --> 01:08:55,323
your computer or phone spontaneously reboots or dies or does something wrong,

1990
01:08:55,493 --> 01:08:57,413
it's probably not your fault per se.

1991
01:08:57,502 --> 01:08:59,854
It's some other human elsewhere did not.

1992
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,870
Correct code they didn't anticipate cases like these.

1993
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,680
But now let's use some terminology here.

1994
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:08,839
There's some salient ideas that we're going to see in scratch and

1995
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:11,709
C and Python and these other languages I alluded to earlier.

1996
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:13,560
Everything I've just highlighted here

1997
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:16,200
henceforth we're gonna think of as functions.

1998
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,430
Functions are verbs or actions that really get some small piece of work done for you.

1999
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,589
Functions are verbs or actions.

2000
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:26,040
Here though highlighted is the beginning of what we'll call.

2001
01:09:26,194 --> 01:09:27,104
Conditions,

2002
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:28,904
conditionals like a fork in the road.

2003
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:29,895
Do I go this way?

2004
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:30,785
Do I go this way,

2005
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:32,214
or some other way altogether?

2006
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:34,935
How do you decide what road to go down?

2007
01:09:35,185 --> 01:09:37,615
We're going to call these questions you ask yourself

2008
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:39,415
Boolean expressions,

2009
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:40,785
named after a mathematician Bull,

2010
01:09:40,984 --> 01:09:44,384
and a boolean expression is just a question that has a yes or no

2011
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:49,214
answer or a true or false answer or a 1 or zero answer.

2012
01:09:49,265 --> 01:09:50,745
Just it's a binary state,

2013
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:52,305
yes or no typically.

2014
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:55,939
Otherwise we have this go back to go back to,

2015
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,169
which is what we're generally kind of

2016
01:09:57,169 --> 01:10:00,049
call a loop which somehow induces cyclical behavior

2017
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,509
again and again

2018
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:03,870
and those functions and those conditionals,

2019
01:10:03,879 --> 01:10:06,740
boolean expressions and loops and a few other concepts are pretty

2020
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,569
much what will underlie all of the code that we write,

2021
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,689
whether it is in

2022
01:10:10,799 --> 01:10:11,310
scratch,

2023
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:11,930
C,

2024
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,700
or something else altogether.

2025
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,660
But we need to get to that point

2026
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:16,799
and in fact,

2027
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,979
let's go and.

2028
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:20,740
Infer what this program here does.

2029
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,390
At the end of the day,

2030
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,470
computers only understand zeros and ones,

2031
01:10:23,629 --> 01:10:26,589
so I claim here is a program of zeros and ones.

2032
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:27,750
What does it do?

2033
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,529
Anyone want to guess?

2034
01:10:31,589 --> 01:10:31,740
I mean,

2035
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:35,160
we could spend all day converting all of these zeros and ones to numbers,

2036
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,220
but they're not gonna be numbers if it's code.

2037
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:37,899
What do you think?

2038
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,160
That's amazing.

2039
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,430
It does in fact print

2040
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:44,240
hello world.

2041
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,259
All right,

2042
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:48,799
so no one except like maybe you and me and a few others in the room should know,

2043
01:10:48,839 --> 01:10:51,600
and that's probably guess admittedly or advancing on the slide,

2044
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,169
but why is that?

2045
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:52,359
Well,

2046
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:55,790
it turns out that not only do computers standardize information,

2047
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:56,939
data like

2048
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,310
numbers and letters and colors and other things,

2049
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:01,339
they also standardize instructions.

2050
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:06,180
And so if you've heard of companies like Intel or AMD or Nvidia or others,

2051
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,479
among the things they do is they decide as a

2052
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,439
company what pattern of zeros and ones shall represent what.

2053
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,000
and it's very low level functionality.

2054
01:11:15,089 --> 01:11:16,649
Those companies and others

2055
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,209
decide that some pattern of zeros and ones means

2056
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:22,720
add two numbers together or subtract or multiply.

2057
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,970
Another pattern might mean load information from

2058
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,810
the computer's hard drive into memory.

2059
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,129
Another might mean store it somewhere else.

2060
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,200
Another might mean print something out to the screen.

2061
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,740
So nested somewhere in here,

2062
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:36,339
and admittedly I have no idea which pattern I'll find because it's

2063
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:38,879
not interesting enough to go figure it out at this level,

2064
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:40,049
says print.

2065
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:41,720
And somewhere in there,

2066
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:43,000
like this gentleman proposed,

2067
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,839
I bet we could find the representation of H,

2068
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,580
which was 72

2069
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:50,939
and E and L and L and O and everything that

2070
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,180
composes hello world because as it turns out in programming circles,

2071
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,729
the very first program that students typically write

2072
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,740
is that of hello world.

2073
01:11:58,899 --> 01:11:59,930
Now this one here

2074
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:00,899
is written

2075
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,129
in a much more intelligible way,

2076
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,259
even if you're not a programmer,

2077
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,529
odds are if I asked you what does this program do,

2078
01:12:06,819 --> 01:12:07,580
you would have said.

2079
01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:10,129
Oh hello world,

2080
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,520
even though there's a lot of clutter here,

2081
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,200
like no idea what this is until next week in main void that looks cryptic.

2082
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,109
There's these weird curly braces which we rarely use in the real world,

2083
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,470
but at least I understand a few words like hello and world,

2084
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,350
and this is kind of familiar print F,

2085
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:24,390
but it's not print,

2086
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:25,790
but it's probably the same thing.

2087
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:27,790
So here too is an example of this

2088
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,560
hierarchy back in the day,

2089
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,319
in the earliest days of computers,

2090
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:34,200
humans were writing code by representing.

2091
01:12:34,325 --> 01:12:35,015
Zeros and ones.

2092
01:12:35,055 --> 01:12:37,365
If you've ever heard your parents talk about punch cards or the like,

2093
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:40,685
you're effectively representing patterns that tell the computer what to do

2094
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:43,444
or what to represent like literally holes and paper.

2095
01:12:43,654 --> 01:12:43,694
Well,

2096
01:12:43,774 --> 01:12:46,205
pretty quickly early on this got really tedious,

2097
01:12:46,415 --> 01:12:48,134
only writing code at such a low level,

2098
01:12:48,214 --> 01:12:49,015
so someone decided,

2099
01:12:49,095 --> 01:12:49,604
you know what,

2100
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:51,044
I'm going to put in the effort.

2101
01:12:51,254 --> 01:12:54,365
I'm gonna figure out what patterns of zeros and ones I can put together

2102
01:12:54,734 --> 01:12:57,884
so as to be able to convert something more

2103
01:12:58,134 --> 01:12:59,365
user friendly.

2104
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,790
To those zeros and ones and as a teaser for next week,

2105
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:04,859
that person invented the first compiler.

2106
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:08,060
A compiler is just a program that translates one language to another,

2107
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,270
and more modernly,

2108
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:10,950
this is a language called C which we'll spend

2109
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,580
a few weeks on together because it's so fundamental

2110
01:13:13,779 --> 01:13:14,600
to how the computer works.

2111
01:13:15,274 --> 01:13:18,424
Even this is going to get tedious by like week 6 of the class,

2112
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:19,595
and this is gonna get stupid,

2113
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:20,515
this is gonna get annoying,

2114
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:21,665
this is gonna get cryptic.

2115
01:13:21,834 --> 01:13:24,834
We're just gonna write print hello on the screen

2116
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:26,955
in order to use a different language called Python.

2117
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:27,424
Why?

2118
01:13:27,785 --> 01:13:29,674
Because someone wrote in C.

2119
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:32,910
A program that can convert Python,

2120
01:13:33,169 --> 01:13:34,890
this is a white lie to C,

2121
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:38,250
which can then be converted to zeros and ones and so forth.

2122
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,009
So in computing there's this principle of abstraction

2123
01:13:41,009 --> 01:13:42,490
where we start with the basics and thank

2124
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,250
God we can all trust that someone else

2125
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,439
solved these really hard problems way long ago.

2126
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,560
Then they wrote programs to make it easier.

2127
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,250
We wrote programs to make it easier.

2128
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:54,839
You can now write code like I did with the chatbot to make things even easier.

2129
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:55,160
Why?

2130
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:59,410
Because OpenAI and other companies have abstracted away a lot of the lower level.

2131
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:02,939
Implementation details and that's where I think this stuff gets really exciting.

2132
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:06,060
We can stand on the shoulders of others so long as we know how

2133
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:09,350
to use and assemble these kinds of building blocks.

2134
01:14:09,509 --> 01:14:10,870
And speaking of building blocks,

2135
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,740
let's start here.

2136
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,270
Now odds are some of you might have started

2137
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,310
here in like grade school playing with scratch,

2138
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:17,109
and it's great for like after school programs,

2139
01:14:17,229 --> 01:14:18,220
learning how to program,

2140
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,419
and you probably used it

2141
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:22,859
this language to make games and graphics and just maybe playful.

2142
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:23,879
Art or the like,

2143
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:24,930
but in Scratch,

2144
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:28,240
which is a graphical programming language designed about 20 years ago

2145
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,640
from our friends down the road at MIT's Media Lab,

2146
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:33,529
it represents pretty much everything we're going to

2147
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:36,810
be doing fundamentally over the next several weeks in

2148
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:40,129
more modern languages like C and Python,

2149
01:14:40,169 --> 01:14:41,839
more textual languages if you will.

2150
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:46,049
I bet I could ask the group here what does this program do when you click a green flag.

2151
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,850
Well,

2152
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,419
it says

2153
01:14:47,589 --> 01:14:49,419
hello world on the screen,

2154
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:50,509
because with Scratch,

2155
01:14:50,589 --> 01:14:53,029
you have the ability to express yourself with functions

2156
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:54,979
and loops and conditionals and all of this,

2157
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:56,379
but by using

2158
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,549
drag and drop puzzle pieces.

2159
01:14:58,629 --> 01:14:59,939
So what we're about to do is this.

2160
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:02,910
We're going to go on my screen to scratch.mit.edu.

2161
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:04,709
It's a browser-based programming environment,

2162
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,339
and we're only going to spend one week,

2163
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,140
really a few days in CS 50 on this language,

2164
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:11,910
but the overarching goal is to one,

2165
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:13,560
make sure everyone's comfortable applying some

2166
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,589
of these building blocks and actually.

2167
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:18,279
Developing something that's interesting and visual and audio as well,

2168
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,509
but to also give us some visuals that we can rely on and fall back on

2169
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:25,399
when all of those curly braces and parentheses and

2170
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:28,770
sort of stupid syntax comes back that's necessary in

2171
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:32,080
many languages but can very quickly become a distraction

2172
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,899
early on from the interesting and useful ideas.

2173
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,109
So what we're about to see is this in a browser.

2174
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:39,520
This is the scratch programming environment and there's

2175
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,750
a few different parts of this world.

2176
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:41,959
This is the blocks palette,

2177
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,600
so to speak.

2178
01:15:43,069 --> 01:15:43,250
Uh,

2179
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:47,299
that is to say there's a bunch of puzzle pieces or building blocks that represent

2180
01:15:47,629 --> 01:15:52,359
functions and conditionals and and uh loops and other such constructs.

2181
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:54,549
There's going to be the programming area here where you can

2182
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:57,910
actually write your code by dragging and dropping these puzzle pieces.

2183
01:15:57,959 --> 01:15:58,310
There's a whole.

2184
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:01,410
whole world of sprites here by default scratch is

2185
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:03,939
and is a cat by design,

2186
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,810
but you can make scratch look like a dog,

2187
01:16:05,859 --> 01:16:06,220
a bird,

2188
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,299
a garbage can,

2189
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:07,890
or anything else,

2190
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:08,850
as we'll soon see.

2191
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,580
And then this is the world in which Scratch itself lives.

2192
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,770
So Scratch can go up,

2193
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:13,029
down,

2194
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:13,299
left,

2195
01:16:13,339 --> 01:16:13,810
right,

2196
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,089
and generally be animated within that world.

2197
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:16,919
For the curious,

2198
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,689
kind of like high school geometry class,

2199
01:16:18,859 --> 01:16:20,250
there's sort of this XY plane here,

2200
01:16:20,299 --> 01:16:22,009
so 00 would be in the middle,

2201
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,689
0 180 is here,

2202
01:16:23,799 --> 01:16:24,490
0.

2203
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:26,060
180 is here.

2204
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:26,859
Uh,

2205
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,029
-240,

2206
01:16:28,109 --> 01:16:28,939
0 is here,

2207
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:30,549
and 240 0 is here.

2208
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:32,580
Generally you don't need to worry about the numbers,

2209
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:35,779
but they exist so that when you say up or down,

2210
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:39,430
you can actually tell the program go up one pixel or 10 pixels

2211
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:42,859
or 100 pixels so that you have some definition of what this world

2212
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:44,779
actually is.

2213
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:45,279
All right,

2214
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,100
so let's actually put this to the test.

2215
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:50,709
Let me go ahead here and flip over to in just a moment.

2216
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,479
The actual Scratch website

2217
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,600
whereby

2218
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,200
I'm gonna have on my screen in just a moment,

2219
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,879
that same user interface,

2220
01:16:59,049 --> 01:17:00,080
once I've logged in.

2221
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:04,020
That via which I can actually write some code of my own.

2222
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:05,750
Let me go ahead and zoom in on the screen a little

2223
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,549
bit here and let's make the simplest of these programs first.

2224
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:10,819
Maybe a program that simply says he world.

2225
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:11,709
Now at a glance,

2226
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:14,100
it's kind of overwhelming how many puzzle pieces there are,

2227
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:14,709
and honestly,

2228
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,500
even over 20 years I've never used them all,

2229
01:17:16,509 --> 01:17:18,029
and MIT occasionally adds to it.

2230
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:20,299
But the point is that they're color coded

2231
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,100
to resemble the type of functionality that they offer

2232
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,470
and also it's meant to be the sort of thing where you can.

2233
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:26,692
Kind of scroll through

2234
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:29,482
and get a visual sense of like what you could do and

2235
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:32,513
then figure out how you might assemble these puzzle pieces together.

2236
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:37,232
So I'm going to go under this yellow or orangeish category here to begin with.

2237
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,513
So there exists in the world of Scratch,

2238
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:43,203
not quite the same jargon that I'm using now functions

2239
01:17:43,203 --> 01:17:46,033
and conditionals and loops that's more of the programmer's way.

2240
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,522
This is more of the child friendly way,

2241
01:17:47,603 --> 01:17:48,953
but it's really the same idea

2242
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:50,203
under events.

2243
01:17:50,386 --> 01:17:53,366
You have puzzle pieces that represent things that can happen

2244
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,686
while the world is running.

2245
01:17:55,936 --> 01:17:56,565
So for instance,

2246
01:17:56,576 --> 01:18:00,016
the first one here is sort of the canonical when the green flag is clicked.

2247
01:18:00,136 --> 01:18:01,045
Why is that relevant?

2248
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,275
Well,

2249
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,645
in the two dimensional world that Scratch lives in,

2250
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:05,366
there's a stop sign which means stop,

2251
01:18:05,536 --> 01:18:07,246
and there's a green flag which means go.

2252
01:18:07,255 --> 01:18:09,976
So I can therefore drag one of these puzzle pieces

2253
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,525
over here so that when I click that green flag,

2254
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,096
the cat will in fact do something for me.

2255
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,470
Doesn't really matter where I drop it so long as it's somewhere in the middle here.

2256
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,990
I'm gonna go ahead and let go.

2257
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,439
Now I want the look of the cat to change.

2258
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,430
I want to see like a cartoon speech bubble come out for now,

2259
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,450
so I'm going to go under looks here

2260
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,439
and there's a bunch of different ways to say things and think things.

2261
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,805
I'm gonna Keep it simple and just drag this one here.

2262
01:18:33,095 --> 01:18:36,685
And now notice when I get close enough to that first puzzle piece,

2263
01:18:36,895 --> 01:18:39,375
they're sort of magnetic and they want to snap together so I

2264
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:42,125
can just let go and boom because they're a similar shape,

2265
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,234
they will lock together automatically

2266
01:18:44,455 --> 01:18:46,095
and notice too if I zoom in here.

2267
01:18:46,509 --> 01:18:47,759
The white oval,

2268
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,560
which by default says hello,

2269
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:51,810
is actually editable by me because it

2270
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:55,439
turns out that some functions can take arguments

2271
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:58,399
or more generally inputs that influence their behavior.

2272
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:00,160
So if I kind of click or double click on this,

2273
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:01,759
I can change it to the more canonical

2274
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:04,330
Hello world or hello David or hello,

2275
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:06,319
whatever I want the message to be.

2276
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,890
I'm going to go ahead and zoom out and now over here at

2277
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:12,399
top right notice that I can very simply click the green flag and

2278
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:13,330
I'll have written.

2279
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,660
My first program in Scratch.

2280
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,060
I clicked the green flag.

2281
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,750
It said go and now notice it's sort of stuck

2282
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,180
on that because I never said stop saying go,

2283
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,750
but that's where I can click the red stop sign and

2284
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,830
sort of get the cat back to where I want it.

2285
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:28,700
So think about for just a moment

2286
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:30,229
what it is we just did.

2287
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,930
So at the one hand we have a very obvious

2288
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:35,020
puzzle piece that says say and it said something,

2289
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:35,419
but

2290
01:19:35,589 --> 01:19:36,509
it really is a function,

2291
01:19:36,549 --> 01:19:38,459
and that function does take an input

2292
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:40,379
represented by the white oval here.

2293
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:43,419
Otherwise known as an argument or a parameter,

2294
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:46,529
but what this really is is just an input to the function.

2295
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,819
And so we can map even this simple,

2296
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:53,379
simple scratch program onto our model of problem solving before with

2297
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:56,290
an addition of what we'll call moving forward a side effect.

2298
01:19:56,459 --> 01:20:00,240
A side effect in a computer program is often something that happens

2299
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,020
visually on the screen or maybe audibly out of a speaker.

2300
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:06,220
It's something that just kind of happens as a result of you

2301
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:09,379
using a function like a speech bubble appearing on the screen.

2302
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,609
So here more generally is what we claimed it represents the solving

2303
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,250
of a problem and let's just consider what the input is.

2304
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,200
The input to this problem,

2305
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,560
say something on the screen,

2306
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:22,520
is this white oval here that I typed in Hello world,

2307
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:23,850
the algorithm,

2308
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,049
the step by step instruction.

2309
01:20:25,459 --> 01:20:27,589
are not something really I wrote like our friends

2310
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:32,020
at MIT implemented that purple say block so someone there

2311
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,939
knows how to get the cat to say something out of its

2312
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:36,339
comical mouth.

2313
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,740
So the algorithm implemented in code is really equivalent to the say function.

2314
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:44,200
So a function is just a piece of functionality

2315
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,709
implemented in code.

2316
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,640
Which in turn implements an algorithm.

2317
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,229
So algorithm is sort of the concept

2318
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,830
and the function is actually the incarnation of it in code.

2319
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:53,640
What's the output?

2320
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:53,759
Well,

2321
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,490
hopefully it's the side effect,

2322
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,509
seeing the speech bubble come out of the cat's mouth like this.

2323
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:00,040
All right,

2324
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,669
so that's

2325
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:02,509
one such program,

2326
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,069
but it's always gonna play and look the same.

2327
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,350
What if I actually want to prompt the human

2328
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:09,250
for their actual name?

2329
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:09,450
Well,

2330
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,640
let me go back to the puzzle pieces here.

2331
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,979
Let me go ahead and throw this whole thing away,

2332
01:21:14,009 --> 01:21:15,129
and if you want to delete blocks,

2333
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:17,799
you can either right click or control click and choose from a menu,

2334
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,919
or you can just drag them there and sort of let go,

2335
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
and they'll disappear.

2336
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:22,819
I'm going to go back in and get another,

2337
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:24,560
another event block,

2338
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:26,720
even though I could have reused that same one.

2339
01:21:27,009 --> 01:21:29,600
I'm going to go ahead and go under sensing now,

2340
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:30,930
and if I zoom in over here,

2341
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:34,330
you'll see a whole bunch of things like I can sense distance and colors,

2342
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:37,450
but more pragmatically I can use this function in blue.

2343
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:39,410
Ask something

2344
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,370
and then wait for the answer.

2345
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:44,020
And what's different about this puzzle piece is that it

2346
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,009
too is just a function it too takes an argument,

2347
01:21:47,259 --> 01:21:48,779
but instead of having an immediate side

2348
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,890
effect like displaying something on the screen,

2349
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,529
it's essentially

2350
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,490
inside of the computer going to hand me back the response.

2351
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,819
It's going to return a value,

2352
01:21:58,859 --> 01:21:59,470
so to speak,

2353
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:02,330
and a return value is something that the code can see,

2354
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,259
but the human can't.

2355
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:05,270
A side effect is something the human sees,

2356
01:22:05,509 --> 01:22:07,709
but a return value is something only the computer sees.

2357
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,689
It's like the computer is handing me back

2358
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:11,089
the user's input.

2359
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:12,040
So how does this work?

2360
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:12,259
Well,

2361
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,669
notice,

2362
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:13,819
and this is a bit strange,

2363
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,660
this isn't usually how variables work,

2364
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,830
but scratch 2 supports variables,

2365
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:21,740
and that was a word I used quickly at the very start when we were making the chatbot,

2366
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,350
a variable like in math,

2367
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:23,740
X,

2368
01:22:23,859 --> 01:22:23,910
Y,

2369
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:25,259
or Z just stores some value,

2370
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:28,950
but it doesn't have to store a number in code it can store like a human name.

2371
01:22:29,259 --> 01:22:31,729
So what's going to happen when I use this puzzle piece is

2372
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:34,000
that once the human types in their name and hits enter,

2373
01:22:34,209 --> 01:22:34,939
MIT,

2374
01:22:35,089 --> 01:22:36,040
or really scratch,

2375
01:22:36,169 --> 01:22:37,799
is going to store the answer,

2376
01:22:38,049 --> 01:22:39,290
the so-called return value,

2377
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:42,319
in a variable that's designed to be called answer.

2378
01:22:42,569 --> 01:22:43,560
But as we'll see,

2379
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:45,729
you can make your own variables down the line

2380
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:48,299
if you want and call them anything you want.

2381
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,839
But let me go ahead and zoom out.

2382
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:51,520
Let me drag this over here.

2383
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:53,609
I'm going to use the default question What's your name?

2384
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:55,959
But I could certainly change the text there

2385
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:58,049
and let me go under looks again.

2386
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,240
Let me go ahead and grab the say block

2387
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,720
and let me go ahead and say just for consistency like hello,

2388
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:05,640
comma,

2389
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:06,919
OK,

2390
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,209
and now let me go under maybe sensing.

2391
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,069
I want to say

2392
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,750
how do I wanna say this answer.

2393
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:11,890
Well,

2394
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,919
notice this the shapes are important.

2395
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,049
This too is an oval,

2396
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:16,000
even though it's not white,

2397
01:23:16,089 --> 01:23:17,450
but that's just because it's not editable.

2398
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:18,839
It's gonna be handed to me

2399
01:23:19,169 --> 01:23:20,680
by the As function.

2400
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:23,040
Let me zoom out and grab a second

2401
01:23:23,529 --> 01:23:24,359
say block

2402
01:23:24,509 --> 01:23:25,330
like this,

2403
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:27,569
and notice it will magnetically clip together.

2404
01:23:27,654 --> 01:23:30,515
I don't want to say hello again so I could delete that,

2405
01:23:30,564 --> 01:23:30,845
but

2406
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,325
now it's still the same shape even though it's a little smaller.

2407
01:23:33,365 --> 01:23:35,955
Let me go back to sensing and notice what can happen here.

2408
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:40,314
When you have values like words inside of a so-called variable,

2409
01:23:40,524 --> 01:23:43,524
you can use those instead of manual input at your keyboard

2410
01:23:43,524 --> 01:23:46,115
and notice it you wants the magnetic slap into place,

2411
01:23:46,225 --> 01:23:49,314
it'll grow to fit that variable because the shape is the same.

2412
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:50,595
And now let's do this.

2413
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:52,444
Let me click the green flag at right.

2414
01:23:52,839 --> 01:23:53,979
I'm seeing quote unquote,

2415
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:54,770
what's your name,

2416
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,299
I'm getting a text box this time,

2417
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:56,890
like on a

2418
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:57,609
web page,

2419
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:58,290
for instance,

2420
01:23:58,459 --> 01:24:00,700
let me type in my name and watch closely what comes out of

2421
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,740
the cat's mouth as soon as I click the checkmark or hit enter.

2422
01:24:05,799 --> 01:24:06,270
Huh,

2423
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:06,640
OK,

2424
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,560
I got my name right,

2425
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,520
but let me do it once more.

2426
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,990
Let me stop and start.

2427
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:11,560
D A V I D.

2428
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,200
Enter

2429
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:14,259
No,

2430
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:14,759
it didn't work.

2431
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:15,600
Let me try one other,

2432
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,470
maybe it's my name.

2433
01:24:16,569 --> 01:24:17,640
Let's try Kelly.

2434
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:19,129
Enter

2435
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:20,600
what's missing obviously.

2436
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:23,049
So the,

2437
01:24:23,129 --> 01:24:23,870
the hello,

2438
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:24,689
there's a bug,

2439
01:24:24,729 --> 01:24:25,689
a mistake in this program,

2440
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,240
but is there like what explains this even if you've never programmed before,

2441
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,720
intuitively what could explain why I'm not seeing hello?

2442
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:36,629
Exactly,

2443
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,520
it's on two different lines,

2444
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,919
so it's doing one after the other,

2445
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,919
so it is happening.

2446
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:43,720
It's just you and I as the slowest things in the room are just not

2447
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,750
seeing it in time because it's happening so darn fast because my computer's so,

2448
01:24:47,879 --> 01:24:48,000
you know,

2449
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,310
so new and so fast,

2450
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:50,879
it's happening but way too quickly.

2451
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:52,240
So how can we solve this?

2452
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:52,290
Well,

2453
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:54,020
can we solve this in a few different ways,

2454
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,560
and this is where in Scratch,

2455
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:57,560
at least for problems at zero when wherein you'll

2456
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,120
have an opportunity to play around with it.

2457
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,359
I can scroll around here and OK,

2458
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,549
under control

2459
01:25:02,839 --> 01:25:03,919
I see something like weight,

2460
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
so I can just kind of slow things down and now notice too,

2461
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,279
if you hover over the middle of two blocks,

2462
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:10,229
if it's the right shape,

2463
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:12,310
it'll just snap into the middle too or

2464
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,790
you can just so you know,

2465
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,029
kind of drag things away to magnetically separate them,

2466
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,009
but this might solve this,

2467
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,709
so let me hit stop and then start.

2468
01:25:19,959 --> 01:25:21,970
DAVID enter.

2469
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:23,479
Hello

2470
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:24,200
David.

2471
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:24,410
All right,

2472
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,180
that was a little,

2473
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,859
let's do like maybe 2 seconds to see it again.

2474
01:25:28,209 --> 01:25:28,859
Green flag,

2475
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:29,870
D A V I D E.

2476
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,259
hello

2477
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:32,799
David.

2478
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:33,220
All right,

2479
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,520
it's working better.

2480
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:38,270
It's sort of more correct because I'm seeing the hello and the David,

2481
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:39,490
but kind of stupid,

2482
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:39,640
right,

2483
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:40,439
to see one

2484
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:41,270
and then the other.

2485
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:43,080
Wouldn't it be nice to say it all in one breath,

2486
01:25:43,169 --> 01:25:43,879
so to speak?

2487
01:25:44,089 --> 01:25:44,169
Well,

2488
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,209
here's where we can maybe compose some ideas.

2489
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,720
So let me get rid of this weight and the additional block.

2490
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:49,609
Let's confine our.

2491
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:51,720
in just one block,

2492
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,830
but let me go down to operations

2493
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:55,359
where we haven't been before,

2494
01:25:55,529 --> 01:25:56,689
and this is interesting.

2495
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:01,169
There's this bigger oval here that says join two things like apple and banana,

2496
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,089
and those are just random placeholder words that

2497
01:26:03,089 --> 01:26:04,839
you can override with anything you want,

2498
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:06,259
but they're both ovals and white,

2499
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:07,370
which means I can edit them.

2500
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,890
So let me go ahead and do this.

2501
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,839
Let me drag this on top of the save block,

2502
01:26:12,009 --> 01:26:14,560
and this is just gonna therefore uh override

2503
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:15,979
the hello I put there.

2504
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,009
Now I don't wanna say apple or banana,

2505
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:19,319
but I do want to say hello,

2506
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:20,169
comma.

2507
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:22,310
And I then want to say my name.

2508
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:22,680
OK,

2509
01:26:22,839 --> 01:26:24,470
so now I can go back to sensing,

2510
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,600
go back to answer,

2511
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,029
drag and drop this here.

2512
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:30,430
That'll snap into place and let me zoom in.

2513
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,910
Now what I've done is take a function and on top of it I nested another function,

2514
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,430
the join function that takes two arguments or inputs

2515
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,750
and presumably joins them together as per its name.

2516
01:26:41,919 --> 01:26:43,509
So let's see what this does for us.

2517
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,229
Let me click stop and start.

2518
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:46,770
I'll type in David,

2519
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:47,680
Enter.

2520
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,390
And it's so close.

2521
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,160
Now this is just kind of an aesthetic bug.

2522
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,430
What have I done wrong here?

2523
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:54,649
There's no space,

2524
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:55,819
so it looks a little wrong,

2525
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:56,910
but that's an easy fix.

2526
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,149
I just need to literally go into the hello block after the comma,

2527
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:04,430
hit the space bar so that now when I stop and start again and type in David,

2528
01:27:04,669 --> 01:27:07,000
now I see something that's closer to the grammar

2529
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:09,700
we might typically expect syntactically here.

2530
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:10,669
All right,

2531
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,399
so let's model this after

2532
01:27:12,669 --> 01:27:13,750
what we just saw earlier.

2533
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:16,299
We've now introduced a so-called return value.

2534
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:20,560
And this return value is something we can then use in the way we want.

2535
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,790
It's not happening immediately like the speech bubble.

2536
01:27:22,959 --> 01:27:25,509
It's clearly being passed to me in some way

2537
01:27:25,759 --> 01:27:27,439
that I can use to plug in somewhere else,

2538
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,729
like into that join block.

2539
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:31,910
So if we consider the role of these variables playing,

2540
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,790
let's consider the picture now as follows.

2541
01:27:33,799 --> 01:27:36,209
If the input now to the first function,

2542
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:37,250
the ask block,

2543
01:27:37,479 --> 01:27:38,229
is what's your name,

2544
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:38,879
quote unquote,

2545
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,459
that's indeed being fed into the ask.

2546
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:43,212
Block and the result this time is not a speech bubble.

2547
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,362
It's not some immediate visual side effect.

2548
01:27:45,612 --> 01:27:49,373
It is the answer itself stored in a

2549
01:27:49,373 --> 01:27:52,683
so-called variable as represented by this blue oval.

2550
01:27:52,853 --> 01:27:53,632
Meanwhile,

2551
01:27:54,013 --> 01:27:57,973
what I want to do is combine that answer with some text I

2552
01:27:57,973 --> 01:28:00,922
came up with in advance by kind of stacking these things together.

2553
01:28:01,053 --> 01:28:02,163
Now visually in scratch,

2554
01:28:02,212 --> 01:28:03,522
you're stacking them on top,

2555
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:04,292
but it's really.

2556
01:28:04,395 --> 01:28:06,786
You're passing one into the other into the

2557
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:08,846
other because much like math when you have the

2558
01:28:08,846 --> 01:28:10,585
parentheses and you're supposed to do what's inside

2559
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,375
the parentheses and then work your way out,

2560
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:13,605
same idea here.

2561
01:28:13,686 --> 01:28:17,375
You want to join hello and answer together and whatever that output is,

2562
01:28:17,675 --> 01:28:20,755
that then becomes the input to the say block which

2563
01:28:20,755 --> 01:28:23,855
like in math is outside of the joined block itself.

2564
01:28:23,956 --> 01:28:25,916
So pictorally it might now look like this.

2565
01:28:26,136 --> 01:28:28,025
There's two inputs to this story.

2566
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:28,990
Hello,

2567
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,399
space and the answer variable.

2568
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,120
The puzzle piece in question is joined.

2569
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:37,549
Its goal in life had better be to give me the full phrase that I want,

2570
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:38,759
hello David.

2571
01:28:38,879 --> 01:28:41,850
Let's shift everything over now because that output is

2572
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,069
about to become the input to the say block,

2573
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:48,149
which itself will now have the so-called side effect.

2574
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:52,759
And so this too is what programming and in turn what computer science is about is.

2575
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:56,085
Posing with the solutions to smaller problems,

2576
01:28:56,735 --> 01:28:59,806
solutions to bigger problems using those component pieces,

2577
01:28:59,815 --> 01:29:03,326
and that's what each of these puzzle pieces represents is a smaller problem

2578
01:29:03,536 --> 01:29:05,485
that someone else or maybe even you,

2579
01:29:05,735 --> 01:29:06,886
has already solved.

2580
01:29:07,056 --> 01:29:09,445
Now we can kind of spice things up here if I go back to

2581
01:29:09,855 --> 01:29:10,815
scratches interface,

2582
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:12,496
we don't have to use just the puzzle piece here.

2583
01:29:12,536 --> 01:29:13,726
I can do something like this.

2584
01:29:13,976 --> 01:29:17,226
Let me go ahead and drag these apart and get rid of the same block down here.

2585
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:17,751
Just for fun,

2586
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:20,461
there's all these extensions that you can add over the internet

2587
01:29:20,711 --> 01:29:22,071
to your own scratch environment,

2588
01:29:22,151 --> 01:29:24,861
and if I go to like text to speech down here,

2589
01:29:25,071 --> 01:29:30,622
I can for instance do a speak block instead of a say block color here in green.

2590
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:33,591
I can now reconnect the join block in here and

2591
01:29:33,591 --> 01:29:35,312
if we could raise the volume just a little bit,

2592
01:29:35,432 --> 01:29:36,821
let me stop the old version,

2593
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:38,301
start the new version,

2594
01:29:38,591 --> 01:29:41,461
type in my name and hear what Scratch actually sounds like.

2595
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:43,370
Hello

2596
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,229
David.

2597
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:44,680
OK,

2598
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:45,870
not very catlike,

2599
01:29:45,919 --> 01:29:49,870
but we can kind of waste some time on this by like dragging the set voice to box,

2600
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,959
and I can put this anywhere I want

2601
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:53,310
above

2602
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:54,120
the speak block.

2603
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,149
So I'm just going to put it here,

2604
01:29:55,209 --> 01:29:56,709
even though I've already asked a question.

2605
01:29:56,919 --> 01:29:58,430
Maybe kitten sounds appropriate.

2606
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,549
Let's try again.

2607
01:29:59,919 --> 01:30:00,959
D A V I D,

2608
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,319
meow meow.

2609
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:03,950
OK,

2610
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:05,439
and then let's see,

2611
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,100
uh,

2612
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:06,979
giant,

2613
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:08,069
a little creepier,

2614
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:08,470
here we go,

2615
01:30:08,549 --> 01:30:10,279
DAVID and lastly.

2616
01:30:11,049 --> 01:30:11,620
Hello,

2617
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:12,450
David.

2618
01:30:12,859 --> 01:30:13,259
All right,

2619
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,689
little ransom like instead.

2620
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:15,060
All right,

2621
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,779
so that's just some additional puzzle pieces,

2622
01:30:16,819 --> 01:30:18,209
but really just the same idea,

2623
01:30:18,299 --> 01:30:19,859
but I like that we've introduced some sounds.

2624
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:20,649
So let's do this.

2625
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:23,020
Let me go ahead and throw away a lot of those puzzle pieces,

2626
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,450
leave ourselves with just the one green flag clicked.

2627
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:27,250
And play around with some other

2628
01:30:27,549 --> 01:30:29,770
building blocks that we've seen already thus far.

2629
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:30,529
Let me go ahead,

2630
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:30,859
for instance,

2631
01:30:30,899 --> 01:30:31,649
under sound,

2632
01:30:31,819 --> 01:30:33,700
and let's make the cow actually meow.

2633
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:34,899
So it turns out scratch,

2634
01:30:34,939 --> 01:30:38,770
being a cat by default comes with some sounds by default like meowing.

2635
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:42,250
So if we go ahead and click the green flag after programming this

2636
01:30:42,919 --> 01:30:43,279
program,

2637
01:30:43,379 --> 01:30:45,100
let's hear what he sounds like now.

2638
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:46,870
OK,

2639
01:30:47,029 --> 01:30:47,689
kind of cute,

2640
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:49,549
and if you want it scratch to meow twice,

2641
01:30:49,629 --> 01:30:51,100
you can just play the game again.

2642
01:30:52,669 --> 01:30:53,649
And a third time,

2643
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:54,819
Alright,

2644
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:56,189
but that's gonna get a little tedious,

2645
01:30:56,339 --> 01:30:57,100
as cute as it is,

2646
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,140
so I can solve that.

2647
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:00,540
Let's just grab 3 of the puzzle pieces and

2648
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,279
just drag them together and let them connect,

2649
01:31:02,299 --> 01:31:03,580
and now click the green flag.

2650
01:31:05,979 --> 01:31:06,220
All right,

2651
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:06,729
doesn't,

2652
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,209
it gets less cute quickly,

2653
01:31:08,299 --> 01:31:09,689
but maybe we can slow it down

2654
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:11,250
so that the cat doesn't sound so,

2655
01:31:11,259 --> 01:31:12,299
so hungry maybe.

2656
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,370
Let me go under,

2657
01:31:13,379 --> 01:31:13,850
uh,

2658
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,589
let's see,

2659
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:15,770
under control,

2660
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:16,620
let's grab one of those,

2661
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,759
wait one second,

2662
01:31:17,779 --> 01:31:20,049
and maybe plop a couple of these in the middle here,

2663
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:20,930
that might help things,

2664
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:22,290
and now click the green flag.

2665
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:25,439
OK,

2666
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,720
still a little hungry,

2667
01:31:26,879 --> 01:31:28,509
but let's see if we change it to 2,

2668
01:31:28,759 --> 01:31:31,240
and then I change it to 2 down here in both places,

2669
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,160
let's play it again.

2670
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:35,950
OK,

2671
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:36,580
cuter,

2672
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:37,140
maybe.

2673
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:41,450
But now I'm venturing into badly programmed territory.

2674
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:42,160
This is correct.

2675
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:44,459
If my goal is to get the cat to meow 3 times,

2676
01:31:44,669 --> 01:31:45,270
pausing in,

2677
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:46,290
sorry,

2678
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,979
3 times,

2679
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:48,120
pausing in between,

2680
01:31:48,549 --> 01:31:49,350
what is

2681
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,299
bad about this code,

2682
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,500
even if you've never programmed before though?

2683
01:31:54,069 --> 01:31:54,109
Yeah,

2684
01:31:54,189 --> 01:31:54,709
in the middle.

2685
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:56,910
Yeah,

2686
01:31:56,990 --> 01:31:58,819
I literally had to repeat myself 3 times,

2687
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,310
essentially copy pasting,

2688
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:03,189
and frankly I could have been really lazy and I could right click or control click,

2689
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,160
and I could have chosen duplicate,

2690
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:09,979
but generally when you copy paste code or when you duplicate puzzle pieces,

2691
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:12,120
probably doing something wrong.

2692
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:12,720
Why?

2693
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,740
It's solving the problem correctly,

2694
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:15,870
but it's not well designed,

2695
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:19,189
even if for only because when I changed the number of seconds,

2696
01:32:19,229 --> 01:32:20,669
now I had to change it in two places.

2697
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:21,629
So I had one.

2698
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:22,549
Initially,

2699
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,129
then I had to change it to 2,

2700
01:32:24,299 --> 01:32:28,140
and if you just imagine in your mind's eye having not like 6 puzzle pieces,

2701
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:31,000
but 60 or 600 or 6000,

2702
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,220
you're going to screw up eventually if it's on you to

2703
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,410
remember to change something here and here and here and here,

2704
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:36,899
like you're going to mess up.

2705
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,370
It's better to keep things simple and ideally centralized

2706
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:44,500
by factoring out common functionality and clearly playing sound

2707
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,939
and waiting is something I'm doing at least twice,

2708
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,009
if not a third time here as well.

2709
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:50,339
So how can we do this better?

2710
01:32:50,459 --> 01:32:50,580
Well,

2711
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:51,540
remember this thing.

2712
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,919
Loops.

2713
01:32:52,939 --> 01:32:55,250
Maybe we can just do something a little more cyclically.

2714
01:32:55,339 --> 01:32:57,060
So I tell the computer to do something once,

2715
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,450
but I tell it how many times

2716
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:59,830
to do that altogether.

2717
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,620
So notice here by coincidence under control I

2718
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,899
have a repeat block which doesn't say loop,

2719
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:06,640
but that's certainly the right semantics.

2720
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:08,979
Let me go ahead and drag the repeat block in and

2721
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:11,649
I'll change the 10 to 3 just for consistency here.

2722
01:33:11,779 --> 01:33:13,049
I'm going to go back to sound.

2723
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,180
I'm going to go ahead and play sound.

2724
01:33:14,299 --> 01:33:20,040
Meow until done just as before and just so it's not meowing too fast under control,

2725
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,410
I'm going to grab a wait one second and keep it inside the loop

2726
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:28,319
and notice that the loop here is sort of hugging these puzzle pieces by growing

2727
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,720
to fill however many pieces I actually cram in there.

2728
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,129
So now if I click play,

2729
01:33:33,209 --> 01:33:34,330
the effect is going to be the same,

2730
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:36,640
but it's arguably not only correct but also

2731
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:37,770
well.

2732
01:33:38,709 --> 01:33:39,509
Designed,

2733
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:42,540
because now if I wanna change the weight,

2734
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:43,629
change it in one place,

2735
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,540
if I want to change the total number of times,

2736
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,830
change it in one place,

2737
01:33:46,879 --> 01:33:48,879
so I've modularized the code

2738
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:51,580
and made it better designed in this case,

2739
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,069
but now this is silly because,

2740
01:33:53,859 --> 01:33:54,330
Even

2741
01:33:54,459 --> 01:33:55,029
though

2742
01:33:55,419 --> 01:33:56,580
I want the cat to meow,

2743
01:33:56,779 --> 01:33:59,020
it feels like any program in which I want this cat to meow,

2744
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:02,250
I have to make these same puzzle pieces and connect them together.

2745
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:05,060
Wouldn't it be nice to invent the notion of meowing

2746
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:07,939
once and then actually have a puzzle piece called meow?

2747
01:34:07,979 --> 01:34:09,020
So when I want the cat to meow,

2748
01:34:09,029 --> 01:34:09,799
it will just

2749
01:34:10,299 --> 01:34:10,879
meow.

2750
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:11,140
Well,

2751
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,129
I can do that too.

2752
01:34:12,259 --> 01:34:14,299
Let me scroll down to my blocks.

2753
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:17,045
Here in pink I'm going to click Make a block and I'm

2754
01:34:17,045 --> 01:34:20,116
going to literally make a new puzzle piece that MIT didn't think of

2755
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:23,556
called meow and I'm going to go ahead and click OK.

2756
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:28,605
Now I have in my code area here a define block,

2757
01:34:28,645 --> 01:34:31,596
which literally means define meow as follows.

2758
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:33,246
So how am I going to do this?

2759
01:34:33,525 --> 01:34:33,565
Well,

2760
01:34:33,645 --> 01:34:34,956
I'm going to propose that me.

2761
01:34:35,082 --> 01:34:37,421
Ming just means to play the sound,

2762
01:34:37,591 --> 01:34:38,702
meow until done,

2763
01:34:38,872 --> 01:34:40,301
and then wait 1 2nd.

2764
01:34:40,512 --> 01:34:43,742
And notice now I have nothing inside my actual program

2765
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:46,131
which begins when I click the green flag,

2766
01:34:46,352 --> 01:34:49,901
but notice at top left because I made a block called meow,

2767
01:34:50,111 --> 01:34:52,821
I now have access to one that I can drag and drop.

2768
01:34:53,111 --> 01:34:55,631
So now I can drag meow into.

2769
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:56,830
This loop

2770
01:34:57,169 --> 01:35:02,490
and per my comment about abstracting the lower level implementation details away,

2771
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:06,100
I'm going to sort of unnecessarily dramatically just move that out of the way.

2772
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,740
It still exists.

2773
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:07,609
I didn't delete it,

2774
01:35:07,779 --> 01:35:08,700
but now out of sight,

2775
01:35:08,779 --> 01:35:09,609
out of mind.

2776
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:13,529
Now if you agree with me that meow means for the cat to make a sound,

2777
01:35:13,819 --> 01:35:15,330
we've abstracted away what it means.

2778
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,060
Mechanically

2779
01:35:16,189 --> 01:35:17,459
for the cow to say

2780
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:18,700
that sound

2781
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:21,270
and so we now have our own puzzle piece that I can

2782
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:24,359
just now use forever because I invented the meow block already.

2783
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,140
Now I can do one better than this.

2784
01:35:26,259 --> 01:35:28,830
It would be nice if I could just tell the meow block how many times I

2785
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:33,220
wanted to meow because then I don't need to waste time using loops either myself.

2786
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:34,020
So let me do this.

2787
01:35:34,069 --> 01:35:34,870
Let me zoom out.

2788
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:38,490
And let me go back to my defined block.

2789
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,970
Let me right click or control click and just edit it,

2790
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:42,279
or I could delete it and start over,

2791
01:35:42,339 --> 01:35:43,290
but I'll just edit it

2792
01:35:43,459 --> 01:35:44,580
and specifically let me say,

2793
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,120
you know what,

2794
01:35:45,259 --> 01:35:46,569
let's add an input,

2795
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:49,250
otherwise known as an argument to this meow block,

2796
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:52,959
and we'll call it maybe N from the number of times I want it to meow.

2797
01:35:53,229 --> 01:35:54,580
And just to be super clear,

2798
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,700
I'm going to add a label which has no functional impact,

2799
01:35:56,779 --> 01:35:58,689
but it just helps me remember what this does.

2800
01:35:58,899 --> 01:36:00,459
So I'm going to say meow and time.

2801
01:36:00,553 --> 01:36:01,743
So that when I see the puzzle piece,

2802
01:36:01,783 --> 01:36:04,373
I know what the N actually represents.

2803
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:05,893
If I now click OK,

2804
01:36:06,103 --> 01:36:08,413
my puzzle piece looks a little different at top left.

2805
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:11,933
Now it has the white oval into which I can type or drag input.

2806
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:14,252
Notice down here in the defined block,

2807
01:36:14,422 --> 01:36:15,612
I now see that same

2808
01:36:15,902 --> 01:36:17,123
input called N.

2809
01:36:17,553 --> 01:36:19,092
So what I can do now is this.

2810
01:36:19,303 --> 01:36:20,652
Let me go under control,

2811
01:36:20,663 --> 01:36:23,172
drag the repeat block here,

2812
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:24,612
and I have to do a little switcheroo.

2813
01:36:24,703 --> 01:36:25,703
Let me disconnect this.

2814
01:36:26,386 --> 01:36:28,616
Plug it inside of the repeat block,

2815
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:30,416
reconnect all of this,

2816
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:31,505
and I don't want 10,

2817
01:36:31,516 --> 01:36:31,866
and heck,

2818
01:36:31,905 --> 01:36:33,735
I don't even want 3 down here anymore.

2819
01:36:33,905 --> 01:36:36,695
I can drag this input because it's the right shape

2820
01:36:36,945 --> 01:36:38,085
and now declare

2821
01:36:38,346 --> 01:36:41,306
that meowing end times means to repeat the

2822
01:36:41,306 --> 01:36:44,136
following end times play sound meow until done.

2823
01:36:44,346 --> 01:36:48,496
Wait 1 2nd and keep doing that and total times.

2824
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,866
If I now zoom out and scroll up.

2825
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:54,149
Notice that my usage of this puzzle piece has changed

2826
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:56,939
such that I don't actually need the repeat block anymore.

2827
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:58,390
I can disconnect this

2828
01:36:58,589 --> 01:36:58,990
and heck,

2829
01:36:59,009 --> 01:37:00,879
I can actually right click and

2830
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,379
control click and delete it.

2831
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:04,740
Just use this under the green flag,

2832
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,060
change this to a 3,

2833
01:37:06,069 --> 01:37:06,899
and now

2834
01:37:07,149 --> 01:37:10,259
I have the essence of this meowing program.

2835
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,509
The implementation details are out of sight,

2836
01:37:12,549 --> 01:37:13,069
out of mind.

2837
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:13,790
Once they're correct,

2838
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,500
I don't need to worry about them again,

2839
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:16,589
and this is exactly.

2840
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:18,053
Scratch itself works.

2841
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:22,493
I have no idea how MIT implemented the weight block or the repeat block.

2842
01:37:22,573 --> 01:37:22,752
Heck,

2843
01:37:22,772 --> 01:37:23,772
there's a forever block,

2844
01:37:23,783 --> 01:37:24,803
and there's a few others,

2845
01:37:24,953 --> 01:37:27,933
but I don't need to know or care because they've

2846
01:37:27,933 --> 01:37:31,243
implemented those building blocks that I can then implement myself.

2847
01:37:31,382 --> 01:37:33,453
I don't necessarily know how to build a whole chatbot,

2848
01:37:33,493 --> 01:37:35,562
but on top of OpenAIs,

2849
01:37:35,812 --> 01:37:36,482
API,

2850
01:37:36,542 --> 01:37:37,882
this web-based service,

2851
01:37:38,172 --> 01:37:42,092
I can implement my own chatbot because they've done the heavy lift of actually.

2852
01:37:42,516 --> 01:37:42,905
that

2853
01:37:43,076 --> 01:37:43,666
for me.

2854
01:37:43,835 --> 01:37:43,875
Well,

2855
01:37:43,916 --> 01:37:45,516
let's do just a few more examples here.

2856
01:37:45,556 --> 01:37:46,835
Let's bring the cat all the more to life.

2857
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,346
Let me throw away the meowing.

2858
01:37:48,516 --> 01:37:50,866
Let me open up under when green flag clicked.

2859
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:53,695
How about that forever block that we just glimpsed?

2860
01:37:53,956 --> 01:37:56,945
Let me go ahead and now add to the mix what we called earlier

2861
01:37:57,596 --> 01:38:00,545
conditionals which allow us to ask questions and

2862
01:38:00,545 --> 01:38:02,226
decide whether or not we should do something.

2863
01:38:02,436 --> 01:38:02,996
So under this,

2864
01:38:03,116 --> 01:38:04,945
let me go ahead and under Forever,

2865
01:38:05,395 --> 01:38:07,675
say if the following.

2866
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,339
Is true.

2867
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:09,830
Well,

2868
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:12,500
what boolean expression do I want to ask?

2869
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,680
Well,

2870
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:13,500
let's implement,

2871
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:15,819
how about this program and we'll figure out if it works.

2872
01:38:16,009 --> 01:38:16,109
Uh,

2873
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:17,060
under sensing,

2874
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,439
I'm gonna grab this,

2875
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:19,129
uh,

2876
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:23,339
a very angled puzzle piece called Touching mouse pointer that is the cursor,

2877
01:38:23,709 --> 01:38:26,660
and only if that question has a yes answer,

2878
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:28,020
do I want to

2879
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:30,180
play the sound meow until done.

2880
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:32,589
So let me zoom in here and in English.

2881
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:34,140
What

2882
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:36,359
is this going to implement really?

2883
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:41,819
Just describe what this program does less arcanely as the code itself,

2884
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:42,220
yeah.

2885
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:47,390
Yeah,

2886
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:48,950
if you move the mouse over the cat,

2887
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:50,120
it will make noise,

2888
01:38:50,189 --> 01:38:52,990
so it's kind of like implementing petting a cat,

2889
01:38:53,069 --> 01:38:53,470
if you will.

2890
01:38:53,629 --> 01:38:54,500
So let me zoom out,

2891
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,819
click the green flag,

2892
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:57,580
and notice nothing's happening yet,

2893
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:01,109
but notice my puzzle pieces are highlighted in yellow because it is

2894
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:02,709
in fact still running because it's

2895
01:39:02,709 --> 01:39:05,500
doing something forever and it's constantly checking

2896
01:39:05,709 --> 01:39:07,580
if I'm touching the mouse pointer,

2897
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:08,709
and if so.

2898
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:11,229
It's like I just pet the cat.

2899
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:13,470
Now it stopped until I moved the cursor again.

2900
01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:15,040
Now it stopped.

2901
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:16,350
If I leave it there,

2902
01:39:16,839 --> 01:39:20,029
it's gonna keep meowing because it's gonna be stuck in this loop forever,

2903
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:23,189
but it's correct insofar as I'm petting the cat.

2904
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:24,189
Let me do this though.

2905
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:26,470
Let me make a mistake this time.

2906
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,870
Let me forget about the forever and just do this,

2907
01:39:28,919 --> 01:39:30,609
and you might think this is correct.

2908
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,970
Let me click the green flag.

2909
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:33,479
Now let me pet the cat.

2910
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:35,049
And like

2911
01:39:35,339 --> 01:39:36,770
nothing's actually working here.

2912
01:39:36,899 --> 01:39:38,140
Why though logically.

2913
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:39,479
Yeah.

2914
01:39:41,339 --> 01:39:41,529
Yeah,

2915
01:39:41,609 --> 01:39:44,129
the program's so darn fast it already ran through the sequence and

2916
01:39:44,129 --> 01:39:46,520
at the moment in time when I clicked the rear flag,

2917
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:46,930
no,

2918
01:39:47,009 --> 01:39:49,729
I was not touching the mouse pointer and so it was

2919
01:39:49,729 --> 01:39:52,200
too late by the time I actually moved the cursor there.

2920
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:53,850
But by using the forever block,

2921
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,600
which I did correctly the first time,

2922
01:39:55,770 --> 01:40:00,410
this ensures that Scratch is constantly checking the answer to that question.

2923
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:02,120
So if and when I do pet the cat,

2924
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:03,000
it will

2925
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,089
actually

2926
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:05,919
Detect as much.

2927
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,000
All right,

2928
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:10,129
about a few final examples before you're on your way building

2929
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,609
some of your own first programs with these building blocks.

2930
01:40:12,689 --> 01:40:14,279
Let me go ahead and open up a program

2931
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,450
that I wrote in advance,

2932
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:15,729
in fact,

2933
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:17,359
about 20 years ago,

2934
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:18,259
whereby,

2935
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:19,770
let me pull this up.

2936
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:25,419
Whereby we have in this example a program I wrote called Oscar time,

2937
01:40:25,509 --> 01:40:28,680
and this was the result of our first assignment in this class whereby

2938
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:32,180
when MIT was implementing Scratch for the very first time,

2939
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:35,379
we needed to implement our very own Scratch program as well.

2940
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:37,020
I'm gonna go ahead and full screen it here.

2941
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,350
The goal is to drag as much falling trash as

2942
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:42,350
you can to Oscar's trash can before his song ends,

2943
01:40:42,509 --> 01:40:45,580
for which one volunteer would be handy here.

2944
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:45,830
OK,

2945
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,069
so.

2946
01:40:46,259 --> 01:40:47,669
Hands go up quickly in blue.

2947
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:47,819
Yeah,

2948
01:40:47,919 --> 01:40:48,490
come on up.

2949
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:48,979
All right,

2950
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:49,609
so

2951
01:40:49,859 --> 01:40:51,770
you're playing for a stress ball here if we will.

2952
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,859
At one at some point I'm going to talk over

2953
01:40:53,859 --> 01:40:56,109
what you're actually playing just so that we can point out

2954
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:58,459
what it is we're trying to glean from this program,

2955
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,529
and I'll stipulate this probably took me like 8,

2956
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:01,379
12 hours,

2957
01:41:01,419 --> 01:41:02,220
and as you'll soon see,

2958
01:41:02,299 --> 01:41:05,259
the song starts to drive you nuts after a while because I was trying to

2959
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:07,620
synchronize everything in the game to a childhood

2960
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,049
song with which you might be familiar.

2961
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,450
Let me go ahead and say hello if you'd like to introduce yourself.

2962
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:12,660
Oh,

2963
01:41:12,669 --> 01:41:12,950
hello.

2964
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:14,330
So I'm Han.

2965
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:16,959
And uh I'm a first year student.

2966
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,459
I'm pretty excited for this class.

2967
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:19,080
welcome.

2968
01:41:19,149 --> 01:41:19,229
Well,

2969
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:20,620
here is Oscar time.

2970
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:22,779
If you want to go ahead and take control of the keyboard,

2971
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:26,779
all you'll need to do is drag and drop trash that falls from the sky

2972
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:28,189
into the trash can.

2973
01:41:32,089 --> 01:41:32,799
Oh

2974
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:39,629
Anything score is 1.

2975
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,930
Nice score 2.

2976
01:41:47,839 --> 01:41:48,080
All right,

2977
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:49,879
let's see what happens.

2978
01:41:52,879 --> 01:41:54,600
You'll see a sneaker was perfectly timed.

2979
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,399
Thank you very much with the song after figuring

2980
01:41:56,399 --> 01:41:57,939
out exactly how many seconds it had to wait.

2981
01:41:58,709 --> 01:42:00,790
Now Han can drag not only the piece of trash,

2982
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:02,490
but the shoe as well.

2983
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:07,479
And it's around this point in the game where

2984
01:42:07,479 --> 01:42:09,290
the novelty starts to wear off because it's like

2985
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:12,669
3 more minutes of this game where more and more stuff starts to fall from the sky.

2986
01:42:12,799 --> 01:42:13,200
So as Han,

2987
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,080
as you continue to play,

2988
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:14,680
I'm going to cut over.

2989
01:42:14,776 --> 01:42:15,756
Here you keep playing.

2990
01:42:15,966 --> 01:42:18,767
Let's consider how I implemented this

2991
01:42:19,247 --> 01:42:20,146
whereby

2992
01:42:20,526 --> 01:42:21,327
we'll start at the beginning.

2993
01:42:21,407 --> 01:42:24,526
The very first thing I did when implementing Oscar time honestly was the easy part.

2994
01:42:24,646 --> 01:42:27,557
Like I found a lamppost that looked a little something like this,

2995
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:30,557
and I made the so-called costume for the whole stage,

2996
01:42:30,807 --> 01:42:31,526
and that was it.

2997
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:32,526
The game didn't do anything.

2998
01:42:32,537 --> 01:42:33,247
You couldn't play anything.

2999
01:42:33,327 --> 01:42:34,126
You click the green flag,

3000
01:42:34,207 --> 01:42:34,957
nothing happened.

3001
01:42:35,187 --> 01:42:38,716
But then I figured out how to turn the scratch cat,

3002
01:42:38,887 --> 01:42:40,756
otherwise known more generally as a sprite,

3003
01:42:41,046 --> 01:42:41,657
into a trap.

3004
01:42:42,773 --> 01:42:45,894
instead and so the trash can meanwhile is

3005
01:42:45,894 --> 01:42:48,094
clearly animated because I realized that oh,

3006
01:42:48,133 --> 01:42:51,454
I can give sprites like the cat different costumes so I

3007
01:42:51,454 --> 01:42:53,583
can make the cat not only look like a trash can,

3008
01:42:53,813 --> 01:42:55,403
but if I want its lid to go up,

3009
01:42:55,534 --> 01:42:55,684
well,

3010
01:42:55,693 --> 01:42:57,213
that's just another costume.

3011
01:42:57,264 --> 01:42:58,883
And if I want to see Oscar popping out,

3012
01:42:58,974 --> 01:43:00,684
that's just a third costume.

3013
01:43:00,733 --> 01:43:03,753
And so I made my own simplistic animation

3014
01:43:04,014 --> 01:43:04,883
and you can kind of see it.

3015
01:43:04,894 --> 01:43:08,023
It's very jittery step by step by step

3016
01:43:08,293 --> 01:43:08,733
by creating.

3017
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:10,460
illusion of animation by really just having a

3018
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,931
few different images or costumes on Oscar.

3019
01:43:13,141 --> 01:43:14,741
I hope you appreciate how much effort went

3020
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:16,340
involved into timing each of these pieces of

3021
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:20,250
trash with the specific mention of that type of piece of trash in the music.

3022
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:20,500
OK,

3023
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:21,210
20 years later,

3024
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:22,050
still clinging.

3025
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,570
So you're doing amazing,

3026
01:43:23,741 --> 01:43:24,411
by the way.

3027
01:43:24,621 --> 01:43:26,780
How do we get the trash to fall in the first place?

3028
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:26,891
Well,

3029
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:27,891
at the very beginning of the game,

3030
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,491
the trash just started falling from some random location.

3031
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:32,650
What does it mean for trash to fall from the sky?

3032
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:34,130
Oh,

3033
01:43:34,581 --> 01:43:35,601
big climax here.

3034
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,899
So you've got a lot of trash on the ground you should pick up.

3035
01:43:43,799 --> 01:43:44,430
There we go,

3036
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:46,040
and your final score is.

3037
01:43:49,089 --> 01:43:50,660
A big round of applause if we go for hot.

3038
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:51,750
OK.

3039
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:53,459
Thank you.

3040
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:55,930
So

3041
01:43:56,359 --> 01:43:56,950
just to be clear,

3042
01:43:57,009 --> 01:44:00,200
now let's decompose this fairly involved program that took me

3043
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,200
a lot of hours to make into its component parts.

3044
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,669
So this is just a sprite,

3045
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,850
and I figured out eventually how to change its costume,

3046
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:07,560
change its costume,

3047
01:44:07,649 --> 01:44:10,009
change its costume to simulate some kind of animation.

3048
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,439
And I also realized that oh,

3049
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:14,290
I don't need to just have one Sprite or one cat or trash can.

3050
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:15,529
You can create a 2nd Sprite,

3051
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,160
a 3rd Sprite,

3052
01:44:16,169 --> 01:44:16,910
and many more.

3053
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:20,319
So I just told the Sprite to go to a random location

3054
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:24,279
at Y equals 180 and X equals something.

3055
01:44:24,384 --> 01:44:26,044
I think I restricted X to be in this region,

3056
01:44:26,095 --> 01:44:28,115
which is why the trash never falls from over here.

3057
01:44:28,274 --> 01:44:29,814
I just a little bit of math based on that

3058
01:44:29,814 --> 01:44:31,964
Cartesian plane that we saw a slide of earlier.

3059
01:44:32,134 --> 01:44:32,685
And then

3060
01:44:32,895 --> 01:44:35,714
I probably had a loop that told the trash to move a pixel,

3061
01:44:35,975 --> 01:44:36,604
move a pixel,

3062
01:44:36,774 --> 01:44:37,475
move a pixel down,

3063
01:44:37,495 --> 01:44:38,604
down,

3064
01:44:38,654 --> 01:44:38,685
down,

3065
01:44:38,734 --> 01:44:41,395
down until it eventually hits the bottom and therefore just stops.

3066
01:44:41,455 --> 01:44:43,404
So we can actually see this step by step,

3067
01:44:43,415 --> 01:44:46,375
and this is representative of how even for something like your

3068
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:49,645
first problem set in CS 50 and with Scratch specifically,

3069
01:44:49,975 --> 01:44:51,725
you might build some of the same.

3070
01:44:51,854 --> 01:44:53,294
So I'm gonna go back into.

3071
01:44:53,959 --> 01:44:55,479
CS 50 Studio for today,

3072
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,200
which is linked on the course's website which has

3073
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,609
a few different versions of this and other programs

3074
01:45:00,879 --> 01:45:03,189
called Oscar 0 through Oscar 4,

3075
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:05,549
where 0 is the simplest and truly I meant it

3076
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:08,299
when I look inside this program to see my code,

3077
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,270
like this was it.

3078
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:13,279
There was no code because all I did was put the Sprite on the screen and change it

3079
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:17,706
from a cat to a trash can and I Added a cost uh costume for the stage,

3080
01:45:17,795 --> 01:45:18,195
so to speak,

3081
01:45:18,275 --> 01:45:20,826
so that the lamp post would be fixated there.

3082
01:45:21,076 --> 01:45:23,186
If I then go to the next version of code,

3083
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:23,916
version one,

3084
01:45:23,996 --> 01:45:24,666
so to speak,

3085
01:45:24,835 --> 01:45:26,826
then I had code that did this.

3086
01:45:27,036 --> 01:45:29,065
Now notice there's a few things going on here.

3087
01:45:29,315 --> 01:45:30,286
At bottom left,

3088
01:45:30,436 --> 01:45:30,755
you'll see,

3089
01:45:30,786 --> 01:45:31,065
of course,

3090
01:45:31,076 --> 01:45:32,025
the trash can,

3091
01:45:32,186 --> 01:45:33,545
and then at top right the trash.

3092
01:45:33,715 --> 01:45:36,025
Here are the corresponding sprites down here.

3093
01:45:36,116 --> 01:45:37,742
So When Oscar is clicked on here,

3094
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:38,671
the trash can,

3095
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,071
you see the code I wrote,

3096
01:45:40,151 --> 01:45:42,142
the puzzle pieces I dragged for Oscar,

3097
01:45:42,271 --> 01:45:44,102
and in a moment when we click on trash,

3098
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,631
you'll see the code I wrote or the puzzle pieces I

3099
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:50,082
wrote are dragged and dropped for the trash piece specifically.

3100
01:45:50,312 --> 01:45:51,722
So what does Oscar do?

3101
01:45:52,032 --> 01:45:52,461
Well,

3102
01:45:52,751 --> 01:45:55,091
I first switch his costume to Oscar one,

3103
01:45:55,191 --> 01:45:57,782
which I assume is this the closed trash can.

3104
01:45:58,151 --> 01:45:59,142
Then forever,

3105
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:00,682
Oscar does the following.

3106
01:46:00,751 --> 01:46:02,751
If Oscar's touching the mouse pointer,

3107
01:46:02,912 --> 01:46:05,751
then change the costume to Oscar 2.

3108
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:07,060
Otherwise,

3109
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:07,439
that is,

3110
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:08,790
if not touching the mouse pointer,

3111
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,600
change the costume to Oscar one.

3112
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:10,720
Well,

3113
01:46:10,799 --> 01:46:11,870
what's the implication?

3114
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,520
Any time I move the cursor over the trash can,

3115
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,790
the lid just pops up,

3116
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:18,750
which was exactly the animation I wanted to achieve.

3117
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:19,600
Meanwhile,

3118
01:46:19,799 --> 01:46:22,109
if we do this and click the green flag,

3119
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:23,470
you can see that in action,

3120
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:24,359
even for this simple.

3121
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:27,274
If I move the cursor over Oscar,

3122
01:46:27,564 --> 01:46:29,075
we have the beginnings of a game,

3123
01:46:29,125 --> 01:46:30,104
even though there's no score,

3124
01:46:30,165 --> 01:46:31,595
there's no music or anything else,

3125
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,785
but I've solved one of my problems.

3126
01:46:33,964 --> 01:46:34,285
Meanwhile,

3127
01:46:34,325 --> 01:46:36,035
if I click on the trash piece here

3128
01:46:36,325 --> 01:46:39,475
and then you'll see no code has been written for it yet.

3129
01:46:39,685 --> 01:46:42,805
So we move on to Oscar version 2 and see inside it.

3130
01:46:43,290 --> 01:46:44,310
And Oscar version 2,

3131
01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:45,399
when I click on trash,

3132
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:45,750
ah,

3133
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:49,399
now there's some juicy stuff happening here and in fact this

3134
01:46:49,399 --> 01:46:53,350
trash sprite has two programs or scripts associated with it,

3135
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:54,109
and that's fine.

3136
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:56,240
Each of them starts with when green flag clicked,

3137
01:46:56,279 --> 01:46:59,430
which means the piece of trash will do two things at once,

3138
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,830
essentially in parallel.

3139
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,470
The first thing it will do is we'll set drag mode to dragable,

3140
01:47:03,479 --> 01:47:04,799
and that's just a scratch thing that lets you

3141
01:47:04,799 --> 01:47:06,560
actually move the sprites by clicking on them,

3142
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:06,919
making them.

3143
01:47:07,092 --> 01:47:07,712
Dragonable.

3144
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:10,763
Then it goes to a random X location between 0

3145
01:47:10,962 --> 01:47:11,842
and 240.

3146
01:47:11,922 --> 01:47:12,163
So yeah,

3147
01:47:12,243 --> 01:47:15,033
that must be what I did from the middle all the way to the right,

3148
01:47:15,283 --> 01:47:17,562
and I said why always to 180,

3149
01:47:17,603 --> 01:47:20,752
which is why the trash always comes from the sky from the very top.

3150
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:24,073
Then I said forever change your Y by -1,

3151
01:47:24,243 --> 01:47:26,592
and here's where it's useful to know what 180 is,

3152
01:47:26,603 --> 01:47:27,312
240 is,

3153
01:47:27,323 --> 01:47:27,873
and so forth,

3154
01:47:27,882 --> 01:47:29,513
because if I want the trash to go down,

3155
01:47:29,683 --> 01:47:30,333
so to speak,

3156
01:47:30,442 --> 01:47:30,723
that's.

3157
01:47:30,835 --> 01:47:31,605
Changing its Y

3158
01:47:32,005 --> 01:47:33,206
by a pixel by pixel,

3159
01:47:33,286 --> 01:47:33,866
by a pixel,

3160
01:47:34,036 --> 01:47:38,835
and thankfully MIT implemented it such that if the trash tries to go off the screen,

3161
01:47:39,005 --> 01:47:41,875
it will just stop automatically even if it's inside of a

3162
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:44,835
forever block lest you lose control over the sprites altogether.

3163
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,116
But in parallel what's happening is this

3164
01:47:47,485 --> 01:47:49,076
also when the green flag is clicked,

3165
01:47:49,445 --> 01:47:49,565
uh,

3166
01:47:49,605 --> 01:47:54,405
the trash piece is doing this too forever if touching Oscar,

3167
01:47:55,085 --> 01:47:56,556
what's it doing in blue here?

3168
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,560
Sort of teleporting away now to your eye,

3169
01:48:01,759 --> 01:48:04,450
hopefully it looks like it's going into the trash can,

3170
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:06,319
but what does that mean to go into the trash can?

3171
01:48:06,359 --> 01:48:06,410
Well,

3172
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:10,310
I just put it back into the sky as though a new piece of trash is falling.

3173
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:12,879
So even though you saw one piece of trash,

3174
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:14,000
234,

3175
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:14,609
and so forth,

3176
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,950
it's the same sprite just acting that out again and again.

3177
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,720
So here if I click play.

3178
01:48:20,339 --> 01:48:21,310
On this program

3179
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,020
you'll see that it starts falling

3180
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:26,379
one pixel at a time because it's draggable.

3181
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:27,970
I can sort of pull it away

3182
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:30,100
and move it over to the trash can like that,

3183
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:31,209
and as soon as I do,

3184
01:48:31,419 --> 01:48:32,410
it seems to go in,

3185
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:37,580
but really it just teleported to a different X location still at Y equals 180.

3186
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:37,899
Again,

3187
01:48:37,939 --> 01:48:38,819
it's not much of a game yet.

3188
01:48:38,899 --> 01:48:39,450
There's no score,

3189
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:40,370
there's no music or anything,

3190
01:48:40,459 --> 01:48:42,169
but let's go to Oscar 3 now.

3191
01:48:42,419 --> 01:48:43,930
And in Oscar 3,

3192
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,209
if we scroll over to the trash,

3193
01:48:46,459 --> 01:48:48,100
even more is happening here and so.

3194
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,189
As far as I realized,

3195
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:49,779
you know what,

3196
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:52,339
there was kind of inefficiency before.

3197
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:56,189
Previously I had these two programs or scripts synonym

3198
01:48:56,470 --> 01:49:00,790
whereby they both went to the top by going to 0 to 240

3199
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:03,500
for X and then 180 for Y.

3200
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:04,549
And if you noticed,

3201
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:05,620
I used that here

3202
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:07,629
and I used that down here in both programs.

3203
01:49:07,709 --> 01:49:10,779
Now that was kind of stupid because I literally copied and pasted the same code.

3204
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,939
So if I ever want to change that design,

3205
01:49:13,069 --> 01:49:16,069
I have to change it in two places and I already proposed that we frown upon that.

3206
01:49:16,339 --> 01:49:17,759
So what did I do in this version?

3207
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:21,399
I just created my own block and I decided to call my own function

3208
01:49:21,689 --> 01:49:22,520
go to top.

3209
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:24,029
What does it mean to go to the top,

3210
01:49:24,209 --> 01:49:26,180
pick a random X between those values,

3211
01:49:26,410 --> 01:49:29,959
and fixate on Y equals 180 initially.

3212
01:49:30,169 --> 01:49:31,529
Now in both of those programs,

3213
01:49:31,569 --> 01:49:33,040
which are otherwise identical,

3214
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,240
I just say what I mean.

3215
01:49:34,410 --> 01:49:35,120
Go to top,

3216
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,919
go to top,

3217
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:36,770
and if I really wanted to,

3218
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:38,169
I could drag this out of the way and

3219
01:49:38,169 --> 01:49:40,129
never think about it again because now that function.

3220
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:41,520
exists,

3221
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:44,500
so correct but arguably better designed.

3222
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:50,109
I've now factored out commonality so as to use and reuse my code as well.

3223
01:49:50,359 --> 01:49:52,839
So let's go up to Oscar version 4 now,

3224
01:49:52,879 --> 01:49:54,470
and in Oscar time version 4,

3225
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:55,629
the trashcan

3226
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
does a little something more whereby

3227
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:00,919
what have I added to this mix even though

3228
01:50:00,919 --> 01:50:03,910
we haven't dragged this puzzle piece together before.

3229
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:05,439
Yeah,

3230
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,189
what's new?

3231
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:07,350
Yeah,

3232
01:50:07,509 --> 01:50:11,950
so it turns out on the left here there's a variables category which goes

3233
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:16,060
beyond the answer variable that we just automatically get from the ask block.

3234
01:50:16,189 --> 01:50:17,950
You can create your own variables X,

3235
01:50:18,109 --> 01:50:18,229
Y,

3236
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:18,629
Z,

3237
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,200
but in computer programming it's best to name things,

3238
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:23,109
not silly simple words like X,

3239
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:23,270
Y,

3240
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:23,629
and Z,

3241
01:50:23,669 --> 01:50:26,620
but full-fledged words that say what they are like score.

3242
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:28,839
So I'm setting a score variable to 0,

3243
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:30,779
and then any time

3244
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:34,299
the trash is touching Oscar before it teleports away to the top,

3245
01:50:34,509 --> 01:50:35,669
I change the score by 1.

3246
01:50:35,842 --> 01:50:38,022
That is increment the score by 1.

3247
01:50:38,112 --> 01:50:40,112
And what Scratch does automatically for me is it puts

3248
01:50:40,112 --> 01:50:43,502
a little billboard up here showing me the current score.

3249
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,663
So if I now

3250
01:50:45,353 --> 01:50:46,382
play this game

3251
01:50:46,692 --> 01:50:47,462
once more,

3252
01:50:47,752 --> 01:50:49,073
the score is going to start at 0.

3253
01:50:49,192 --> 01:50:53,752
But if I drag this trash over here and even let it fall in as soon as it touches,

3254
01:50:53,792 --> 01:50:54,902
the score goes to 1.

3255
01:50:55,192 --> 01:50:56,603
And now if I click and drag again,

3256
01:50:56,632 --> 01:50:59,143
the score is going to as soon as it touches Oscar,

3257
01:50:59,353 --> 01:51:00,323
going to go to 2,

3258
01:51:00,632 --> 01:51:01,373
and so forth.

3259
01:51:01,393 --> 01:51:03,953
And you saw in the final flurs with Hunt playing that

3260
01:51:03,953 --> 01:51:06,505
once you add The sound and other pieces of trash,

3261
01:51:06,556 --> 01:51:08,155
which are just really other sprites,

3262
01:51:08,195 --> 01:51:10,076
and I just had to wait like a minute,

3263
01:51:10,195 --> 01:51:10,905
wait 2 minutes,

3264
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:12,905
so that the trumpet would fall at the right time.

3265
01:51:13,076 --> 01:51:15,706
I've broken down a fairly involved program

3266
01:51:16,036 --> 01:51:17,476
into these basic building blocks.

3267
01:51:17,556 --> 01:51:19,585
And when you two write your own program,

3268
01:51:19,795 --> 01:51:21,375
that's exactly how you should approach it,

3269
01:51:21,395 --> 01:51:24,306
even if you have these grand aspirations to do this or that,

3270
01:51:24,715 --> 01:51:28,065
start by the simple problems and figure out what bites can I,

3271
01:51:28,255 --> 01:51:28,425
uh,

3272
01:51:28,436 --> 01:51:30,795
bite off in order to make progress,

3273
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:31,425
baby steps,

3274
01:51:31,436 --> 01:51:32,186
if you will,

3275
01:51:32,556 --> 01:51:33,155
to the final.

3276
01:51:33,289 --> 01:51:33,909
Solution.

3277
01:51:34,298 --> 01:51:34,318
Well,

3278
01:51:34,358 --> 01:51:36,599
let's look at one other set of examples before we have

3279
01:51:36,599 --> 01:51:38,918
one final volunteer to come up and as you'll soon see,

3280
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:42,128
it's tradition in CS 50 to end the first class with cake.

3281
01:51:42,199 --> 01:51:43,028
So in a moment,

3282
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:44,758
cake will be served out on the transept,

3283
01:51:44,769 --> 01:51:47,429
and please feel free to come up and say hi and ask questions if you'd like to.

3284
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:49,148
Let me go ahead and open up though

3285
01:51:49,479 --> 01:51:54,349
a series of building blocks here via which we can make so-called IV's hardest game,

3286
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:57,418
which is one implemented by one of your predecessors,

3287
01:51:57,438 --> 01:51:58,628
a former classmate

3288
01:51:58,878 --> 01:51:59,949
from CS 50.

3289
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,918
So here we have a whole bunch of puzzle pieces.

3290
01:52:02,051 --> 01:52:03,231
Written by your classmates,

3291
01:52:03,401 --> 01:52:05,312
but let me go ahead and zoom in on this screen.

3292
01:52:05,521 --> 01:52:07,841
You'll see that this Harvard Crest is my sprite,

3293
01:52:07,881 --> 01:52:08,521
so it's not a cat,

3294
01:52:08,602 --> 01:52:09,361
it's not a trash can.

3295
01:52:09,381 --> 01:52:10,312
It's a Harvard Crest,

3296
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:12,071
and it exists in a very simple

3297
01:52:12,441 --> 01:52:14,872
two-dimensional world with two walls next to it.

3298
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:16,751
If I click on the green flag,

3299
01:52:16,841 --> 01:52:17,591
notice that

3300
01:52:17,762 --> 01:52:18,711
with my hands here,

3301
01:52:18,762 --> 01:52:19,791
I can go up,

3302
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:21,032
I can go down,

3303
01:52:21,202 --> 01:52:22,032
I can go left,

3304
01:52:22,122 --> 01:52:22,992
and I can go right,

3305
01:52:23,082 --> 01:52:24,591
but if I try going too far right,

3306
01:52:24,921 --> 01:52:26,591
I get stuck on the wall.

3307
01:52:26,682 --> 01:52:27,671
If I go too far left,

3308
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:29,551
I get stuck on the wall.

3309
01:52:29,762 --> 01:52:29,841
Well,

3310
01:52:29,921 --> 01:52:30,722
it's the sort of the beginning.

3311
01:52:30,814 --> 01:52:32,115
Of any animation or game,

3312
01:52:32,165 --> 01:52:33,285
but how do I do this?

3313
01:52:33,365 --> 01:52:33,714
Well,

3314
01:52:33,924 --> 01:52:36,435
let me go up here and propose that the first thing

3315
01:52:36,435 --> 01:52:39,125
the Harvard Sprite is doing is it's going to the middle,

3316
01:52:39,245 --> 01:52:40,395
0.0,

3317
01:52:40,595 --> 01:52:41,915
and it's then forever

3318
01:52:42,365 --> 01:52:45,274
listening for the keyboard and feeling for walls.

3319
01:52:45,325 --> 01:52:48,604
Now those are functions I implemented myself to kind

3320
01:52:48,604 --> 01:52:51,125
of describe what I wanted the program to do.

3321
01:52:51,165 --> 01:52:52,714
And let's do the shorter one first.

3322
01:52:52,884 --> 01:52:54,645
What does it mean to feel for the walls?

3323
01:52:54,725 --> 01:52:56,055
Just to ask the question,

3324
01:52:56,165 --> 01:52:57,475
if you're touching the left wall,

3325
01:52:57,834 --> 01:52:59,404
change your X by 1.

3326
01:52:59,910 --> 01:53:01,180
If you're touching the right wall,

3327
01:53:01,549 --> 01:53:03,629
change your X by -1.

3328
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,430
Why have I

3329
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:10,350
defined touching walls in this weirdly mathematical way?

3330
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:10,370
Yeah.

3331
01:53:12,209 --> 01:53:12,339
Sure,

3332
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:12,870
yeah.

3333
01:53:16,209 --> 01:53:17,640
otherwise you're like net.

3334
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:19,850
Exactly,

3335
01:53:20,009 --> 01:53:23,140
because if I've gone so far right that I'm touching the right wall,

3336
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:23,450
well,

3337
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:25,770
I'm already kind of on top of the wall a little bit.

3338
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:28,799
So I effectively want the sprite to bounce off of it,

3339
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,450
and the easiest way to do that is just to say

3340
01:53:30,450 --> 01:53:32,680
back up one pixel as though you can't go any further,

3341
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:33,819
and same for the left wall.

3342
01:53:34,089 --> 01:53:34,370
Meanwhile,

3343
01:53:34,410 --> 01:53:38,799
let me scroll over to the second script or program that's running in parallel.

3344
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:39,569
It's a little longer,

3345
01:53:39,609 --> 01:53:40,209
but it's not more.

3346
01:53:40,509 --> 01:53:41,250
Complicated.

3347
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:43,060
What does it mean to listen for keyboard?

3348
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,520
Well,

3349
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,359
just check if the key

3350
01:53:45,669 --> 01:53:47,020
up arrow is pressed,

3351
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:48,899
change Y by 1.

3352
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:50,060
ergo go up,

3353
01:53:50,189 --> 01:53:51,950
else if the key down arrow is pressed,

3354
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,430
then change Y by -1,

3355
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:54,549
key right arrow is pressed,

3356
01:53:54,589 --> 01:53:55,620
change X by 1,

3357
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:56,339
and so forth.

3358
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:56,669
So again,

3359
01:53:56,709 --> 01:53:58,750
this is where the math and the numbers are useful because

3360
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:00,620
it gives you a world in which to live up,

3361
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,779
down,

3362
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:00,979
left,

3363
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:01,350
right.

3364
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:05,740
Deconstructed into some simple arithmetic values.

3365
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:06,040
All right,

3366
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:09,910
so the net result is that we have a crest living in this world.

3367
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:10,180
Well,

3368
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:13,549
let's add a bit of competition here and then the second version of this game.

3369
01:54:13,759 --> 01:54:15,270
Let me go ahead and full screen it again,

3370
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:15,959
click play,

3371
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,830
and now we'll see

3372
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,040
sort of an enemy

3373
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:20,680
bouncing back and forth autonomously.

3374
01:54:20,759 --> 01:54:22,399
So there's no one playing except me.

3375
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:23,520
I'm controlling Harvard,

3376
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,080
Yale is bouncing on its own,

3377
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:25,720
and nothing bad's.

3378
01:54:25,853 --> 01:54:26,953
Gonna happen if it hits me,

3379
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:27,433
but

3380
01:54:27,643 --> 01:54:29,192
it does seem to be autonomous.

3381
01:54:29,603 --> 01:54:30,643
So how is this working?

3382
01:54:30,882 --> 01:54:30,922
Well,

3383
01:54:30,962 --> 01:54:31,993
if it's doing this forever,

3384
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:33,792
there's probably a forever loop involved.

3385
01:54:33,922 --> 01:54:35,232
So let's see inside here.

3386
01:54:35,442 --> 01:54:39,152
Let's click not on Harvard but on the Yale Sprite,

3387
01:54:39,362 --> 01:54:40,013
and sure enough,

3388
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:41,632
if we focus on this for a moment,

3389
01:54:42,083 --> 01:54:44,873
we'll see that the first thing Yale does is go to 0.0.

3390
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:46,562
It points in direction 90 degrees,

3391
01:54:46,643 --> 01:54:49,433
which just gives you a sense of whether you're facing left or right or wherever.

3392
01:54:49,735 --> 01:54:51,195
Then it forever does the following.

3393
01:54:51,326 --> 01:54:54,206
If it's touching the left wall or touching the right wall,

3394
01:54:54,366 --> 01:54:55,596
I was a little clever this time,

3395
01:54:55,645 --> 01:54:56,295
if I may.

3396
01:54:56,565 --> 01:54:58,956
I just kind of turn around 180 degrees,

3397
01:54:59,005 --> 01:55:02,116
which effectively bounces me back in the opposite direction.

3398
01:55:02,405 --> 01:55:04,445
Otherwise I go ahead and no matter what,

3399
01:55:04,485 --> 01:55:05,476
just move one step.

3400
01:55:05,545 --> 01:55:07,996
And this is why Yale is always moving back and forth.

3401
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:08,835
So a quick question,

3402
01:55:08,846 --> 01:55:12,545
if I wanted to speed up Yale and make this beginning of a game harder,

3403
01:55:12,686 --> 01:55:13,445
what would I do?

3404
01:55:14,689 --> 01:55:14,979
Yeah.

3405
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:17,890
Yeah,

3406
01:55:18,009 --> 01:55:19,919
so let's have it move like 10 steps at a time,

3407
01:55:20,009 --> 01:55:20,129
right?

3408
01:55:20,169 --> 01:55:21,970
This looks like a much harder game if you will,

3409
01:55:22,049 --> 01:55:25,020
like level 10 now because it's just moving so much faster.

3410
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:25,410
All right,

3411
01:55:25,490 --> 01:55:25,600
well,

3412
01:55:25,609 --> 01:55:28,330
let's try a third version of this that adds another ingredient.

3413
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:30,439
Let me full screen this and click play,

3414
01:55:30,649 --> 01:55:33,040
and now you'll see the even smarter MIT

3415
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,859
homing in on me

3416
01:55:35,689 --> 01:55:38,290
by following my actual movements.

3417
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:40,600
So this is sort of like boss level material now.

3418
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:43,049
And it's just gonna follow me.

3419
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,129
So how is this working?

3420
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:44,330
Well,

3421
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:46,450
it's kind of a common game paradigm,

3422
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:47,209
but what does this mean?

3423
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:47,490
Well,

3424
01:55:47,729 --> 01:55:48,799
let's see inside here,

3425
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:50,490
let's click on MIT Sprite,

3426
01:55:50,529 --> 01:55:51,729
it's pretty darn easy.

3427
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:56,540
Go to some random position just to make it a little interesting lest MIT

3428
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:00,660
always start in the center and then forever point towards the Harvard logo outline,

3429
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:03,450
which is the name the former student gave to the costume

3430
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:05,970
that the Sprite is wearing that looks like a Harvard crest,

3431
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:07,009
and then move one step.

3432
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:08,859
So a core layer of the previous question how do

3433
01:56:08,859 --> 01:56:11,859
we make the game harder and MIT even faster?

3434
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:12,180
Well,

3435
01:56:12,259 --> 01:56:14,890
we can change this to be like 10 steps,

3436
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:16,450
and now you'll see

3437
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,490
MIT is a little twitchy because.

3438
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:21,020
This is kind of a visual bug.

3439
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,209
Let me make a full screen.

3440
01:56:23,979 --> 01:56:26,529
Why is this visual glitch happening?

3441
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:29,370
It's literally doing what I told it to do,

3442
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:30,569
just looks stupid,

3443
01:56:30,799 --> 01:56:31,000
yeah.

3444
01:56:35,479 --> 01:56:36,149
say like again.

3445
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:37,979
Yeah,

3446
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:40,979
it's moving so fast that it's sort of going 10 pixels this way,

3447
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:41,589
but then I kind of,

3448
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,700
it kind of overshot me,

3449
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:45,810
so then it's doubling back to follow me again and it's doubling back this way.

3450
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:47,859
And because these are such big footsteps,

3451
01:56:47,939 --> 01:56:48,370
if you will,

3452
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:50,700
it just has this visual effect of twitching back and forth.

3453
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:53,220
So we might have to throttle that back a bit and make it 5 or

3454
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:58,379
2 or 3 instead of 10 because that's clearly not desirable gaming behavior here.

3455
01:56:58,714 --> 01:56:58,915
All right,

3456
01:56:58,995 --> 01:56:59,095
well,

3457
01:56:59,115 --> 01:56:59,875
let's go ahead and do this.

3458
01:56:59,915 --> 01:57:01,915
Let's put them all together just as your

3459
01:57:01,915 --> 01:57:04,705
former classmate did when submitting this actual homework.

3460
01:57:04,955 --> 01:57:05,075
Uh,

3461
01:57:05,154 --> 01:57:08,274
the game will conclude hopefully in an amazing climax where you've won the game,

3462
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:09,145
so we need someone,

3463
01:57:09,194 --> 01:57:13,444
ideally with really good hand-eye coordination to play this final game here.

3464
01:57:13,595 --> 01:57:13,875
Yeah,

3465
01:57:14,075 --> 01:57:14,825
your hand went up first,

3466
01:57:14,834 --> 01:57:15,115
I think.

3467
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:15,314
OK,

3468
01:57:15,404 --> 01:57:16,024
come on up,

3469
01:57:16,234 --> 01:57:18,125
big round of applause because it's a lot of pressure

3470
01:57:18,555 --> 01:57:19,075
to end.

3471
01:57:24,379 --> 01:57:24,950
All right,

3472
01:57:25,419 --> 01:57:26,330
so if you win the game,

3473
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:27,529
cake will be served.

3474
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:29,290
If you don't win the game,

3475
01:57:29,339 --> 01:57:30,490
there will be no cake.

3476
01:57:31,419 --> 01:57:31,729
OK,

3477
01:57:31,939 --> 01:57:33,290
but introduce yourself in the meantime.

3478
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:33,729
Hi,

3479
01:57:33,899 --> 01:57:34,899
I'm Jenny Pan,

3480
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,620
freshman at Hollis,

3481
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:39,910
and I'm actually a CS major or concentration.

3482
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:40,540
Nice to meet you.

3483
01:57:40,709 --> 01:57:41,890
Head to the keyboard here.

3484
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:45,970
This now is the combination of all of those building blocks and even more,

3485
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,750
AKA IB's hardest game,

3486
01:57:47,939 --> 01:57:50,189
you will be in control just as I would of the Harvard Crest,

3487
01:57:50,259 --> 01:57:52,049
and the goal is to make it to the exit,

3488
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:53,569
which is this gentleman on the right here,

3489
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:57,009
and you'll see there's multiple levels where each each level gets a little harder.

3490
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:57,600
All right.

3491
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:58,790
Here we go.

3492
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:00,660
I can't touch this.

3493
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,279
I can't touch this.

3494
01:58:06,529 --> 01:58:07,129
Very good.

3495
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:07,930
I can't touch this.

3496
01:58:09,169 --> 01:58:09,919
Nicely done.

3497
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,660
You can't touch this.

3498
01:58:12,069 --> 01:58:13,870
So the loop has been added for Yale.

3499
01:58:17,049 --> 01:58:17,250
Good.

3500
01:58:17,379 --> 01:58:18,560
2 Yales now.

3501
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:25,589
Alright,

3502
01:58:25,770 --> 01:58:27,200
3 yals now.

3503
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:31,020
Nice.

3504
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:33,160
You can't touch this.

3505
01:58:34,009 --> 01:58:35,060
Here comes MIT.

3506
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:39,509
Very

3507
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:40,930
good,

3508
01:58:41,049 --> 01:58:41,410
yeah.

3509
01:58:43,879 --> 01:58:45,080
Two MITs.

3510
01:58:49,169 --> 01:58:49,560
And get

3511
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:57,870
Nice,

3512
01:58:58,229 --> 01:58:58,779
yes.

3513
01:59:10,109 --> 01:59:10,140
That

3514
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:11,819
I

3515
01:59:15,109 --> 01:59:15,540
Yes.

3516
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:16,979
Now Princeton.

3517
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:21,910
Another Princeton.

3518
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:31,020
2nd to last level.

3519
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:33,859
I

3520
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:37,629
OK

3521
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:55,629
Have a

3522
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:03,089
Let's keep going,

3523
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:03,799
keep going.

3524
02:00:13,649 --> 02:00:13,689
Yeah

3525
02:00:15,919 --> 02:00:15,930
All

3526
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,100
right,

3527
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:18,990
this is CS 15,

3528
02:00:19,109 --> 02:00:20,509
cake is now served.
